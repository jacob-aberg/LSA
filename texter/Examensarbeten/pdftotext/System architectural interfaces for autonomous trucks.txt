Abstract
This thesis evaluates a proprietary interface developed by Scania that connects a third
party developed autonomy solution to the electrical system of a Scania truck. The
autonomy solution is developed for a mining application. While evaluating the interface the focus of the thesis narrows down to how to make the interface scalable and
future proof. The content of this thesis is mainly based upon interviews and internal
Scania documentation. In summary, the two main conclusions that could be drawn
from this evaluation study are, that the interface needs to support a larger amount of
requests from a external control to support that the interface is applicable in many areas. Secondly the idea of a modular electrical system must be carried on to autonomous
applications as well and interface logic must be separated from core functionality of the
electrical system.

Introduction
1.1

Background

According to the 2013 Continental Mobility Study, motorists world wide welcome the
entrance of automated driving on public roads[1]. The entrance of autonomous cars
would enable the human driver to occupy the time in the car with other tasks rather
than driving. One can easily imagine reading the newspaper or watching a movie while
the car drives you safely to work.
But its not only the general public who welcomes automated vehicles in a near future.
Companies in the mining industry predicts that big savings can be achieved by introducing autonomous vehicles in their mining work flow. Mines are usually located far
away from populated areas with developed infrastructure. Since the mines are so far
away from civilization the drivers of the mining trucks and equipment need to move
their lives closer to the mine. This means building homes and schools for the their
families and other very expensive infrastructure. If these companies could replace their
drivers of mining trucks with autonomous trucks, a lot of the expensive infrastructure
can be left unbuilt and costs can be reduced.
In this case a natural resource company here denoted as the Mining company, has
reached the conclusion that costs can be reduced and the safety in the mines can be
increased if the introduction of autonomous trucks is made. In order to evaluate the
cost efficiency of autonomous trucks in their mining operations, they contact a company
that in this report is called the Automation company. The Automation company got
the mission to automate two trucks for research purposes. Together they turn to Scania
and the three parts decide that the autonomous study is feasible. The plan is that the
automation company develops an autonomous solution that incorporates an array of
sensors connected to an ECU that is responsible for all the decision making. This
ECU is from here denoted as the External ECU. The truck is then controlled by this
solution.

1

To enable the trucks to drive autonomously a choice of approach had to be made. One
way to go is using mechanical actuators mounted to the vehicles steering wheel, pedals,
etc. This solution might be simple but is far away from how a autonomous truck would
work from Scanias point of view. Instead a more integrated solution is chosen where
the electrical system of the truck is used to a greater extent. In this solution one could
demand for example braking and vehicle speed electronically and without the need
to interact with the physical pedals. Due to the current properties of the electrical
system in the Scania trucks the project is limited to only enabling control over the
powertrain. This means that a solution for controlling the steering of the trucks is left
to the automation company to find.
At Scania senior engineer Linus Bredberg from the group for Driver Assistance Controls
gets the task to develop the interface that connects the autonomous solution to the
ordinary electrical system of the Scania trucks. This report is mainly based on Bredbergs
documentation and the statements he provided in interviews.

1.2

Project definition and limitations

The purpose of this project is to get a greater understanding of the interface that
connects the autonomous solution to the ordinary electrical system of the Scania trucks.
This includes identification of the limitations embedded in the current solution and
recommendations on how it should change to become scalable and secured for future
development.
The assignment in this project is to evaluate the custom made interface that connects
the electrical system of the truck to the autonomous solution. The work that has been
done can be concretized in to the following tasks.
1. Find out what has been done
2. Determine why one has chosen a specific solution
3. Investigate what can be improved
4. Discover the limitations in the current solution
5. Summarize the affected CAN signals
6. If necessary define new CAN signals

2

The main part of this project is about the evaluation that is described above. Another
important contribution is the analysis, where the information collected is analyzed and
the following question is answered:
Which changes needs to be done in SESAMM electrical system to get a
scalable and future proof interface towards an arbitrary supplier of sensor
equipment?
Under the condition that SESAMM electrical system neither increases in complexity
or in cost. By SESAMM electrical system one is referring to the systems, CAN segments, sensors/actuators, wires and more that is implemented in all trucks that Scania
delivers.
In this project the scope is limited down from the trucks electrical system and the
autonomous solution to the interface that connects them both.
My supervisors in this thesis project were Per Roos from Scania and Annika Stensson
Trigell from KTH.

Method
The content of this report is based on two different types of sources to be able to get the
full picture. When it comes to literature, a minor part is coming from publicly available
literature and a significantly larger part is coming from internal documentation. The
public literature gives a large field of view of what has been done previously in the
field or information about something general. In contradiction to the public literature,
the internal documentation gives the narrower perspective, what has been done in this
specific project and down to the important details. Everything that has been done in
this project is not covered in any documentation, therefore the second large source of
information are interviews. From the interviews information about both details and
the broader perspective could be retrieved.
If one wants to define this thesis in a scientific perspective it is not based strictly on
a quantitative nor a qualitative point of view. The describing parts of this thesis is
leaning more towards a quantitative perspective, being based on the facts of what have
been done.
The other part of the thesis is the evaluation,i.e., an analysis of what could have been
done if the circumstances were different. In the information retrieval of that part a
more qualitative point of view is used to be able to get opinions and thoughts from the
person that has been interviewed.
The interviews were of the type semi structured interview [3] and followed a predefined
interview guide that contained prepared questions. The strength of the semi structured
interview form is that there is room for changing the order of the questions and the
possibility to focus on a specific area during the interview.
To be able to get the most out of all the interviews they were recorded on a digital
media. Afterwards, notes of the interviews were made based in the recordings. The
writing of this report begun early in the thesis project time frame, and information has
been written continuously along interviews and other information retrieval.

The Scania trucks
3.1

Vehicle configuration

The trucks that was provided by Scania for this study were 8x4 trucks with drum
brakes and ABS braking system. It’s not unlikely that customers configure their trucks
from old habit. Drum brakes were chosen because the mining company thought that
they were more robust in the dusty environment of the mine. The transmission is an
Opticruise system.

3.1.1

Modifications needed

Braking system
To enable the external control over the vehicle a number of modifications of the vehicles
had to be done. The first major problem with the current configuration is the ABS
braking system. ABS has no support for network control, therefor it is highly inappropriate for the autonomous application. To enable over network control the ABS needs
to be switched to an EBS (electronic braking system), a functionality that supports
over network control.
Gearbox
One risk with the external control is increased wear on gearbox components, due to for
example pressing down the clutch and requesting acceleration for a too long period of
time. To avoid such risk the gearbox is switched to an fully automatic Allison gearbox.
Instead of a regular clutch Allison is equipped with a fluid drive that transfers the power
from the engine to the gearbox. This gives an increased robustness to the system.

Chapter 4
A brief introduction to SESAMM
Every Scania truck is equipped with a common electrical system, shared by all trucks
delivered by Scania. This electrical system is called SESAMM. SESAMM stands for
Scania Electrical System Architecture Made for Modularization and Maintenance.
As mentioned before SESAMM is made up by all the CAN segments, ECUs, sensors,
actuators and wires in the truck.
The Scania product flora is built upon a modular product system as seen in Figure 4.1.
When ordering a truck one can choose from a number of engines, cabs, gearboxes, axels
and so on, which all fit together. SESAMM is a part of this modular product system
and carries on the thought of using modules. SESAMM is constructed with modules
and scalability in mind to be able to support the customers choices in the configuration
of their trucks. SESAMM is not visible to the customer in the same way as the different
cabs or engines, but is a hidden layer to enable all types of truck configurations.

Figure 4.1: The modular product system [4]

6

The foundation of SESAMM is a CAN network that connects all electrical components
in the truck. The CAN network is based upon several CAN segments that group different functionality together. An example of this can be viewed in Figure 4.2. Between
all the CAN segments there is an ECU that gates useful information from one CAN
segment to another. How this is benefited in the interface discussed in this report can
be read in Chapter 5.

Chapter 5
The interface
5.1

Introduction

The interface that connects the autonomous solution with SESAMM electrical system
is a proprietary interface that allows control over the trucks engine, gearbox and brakes.
There are tree main inputs to the interface
1. Speed
2. Deceleration
3. Maximum allowed gear
When the vehicle is under the control of the autonomous solution it will be denoted as
under external control. The requests from a human driver will always have the priority
over the external control and when the truck in not under external control the truck
can be driven as a standard vehicle.
To prevent misuse of the interface a safety logic is implemented and is here denoted
as the safe stop. The safe stop functionality analyses how the truck is handled by the
external control and can command the truck to a stop if it notices signs of misuse.
Scania want as far as possible prevent accidents that could have been avoided by using
the interface in the right way. More about the safe stop logic can be read about in
Section 5.4.

5.2

Architecture

As said in Section 5.1 the External ECU can communicate and do three types of requests to control the truck. There are two different communication ways for the External ECU, it is connected to two different CAN segments. In Figure 5.2 one can see
that the External ECU is connected to the regular body builder interface and a Scania
ECU via a separate CAN segment. The reason for using a new CAN segment for the
communication between the Scania ECU and the External ECU is to be able to get the
fastest network response possible. In other words one wants to minimize the risk for
delays. The bodybuilder interface is an interface that is usually used by truck bodybuilders to get some functionality from the electrical system of the truck. In this case
the bodybuilder interface is used to control lights and other peripheral functions.

Figure 5.1: Interface architecture
One of the main goals in the development of the interface was to leave the SESAMM
electrical system as untouched as possible, therefore only the Scania ECU has been
altered with and the rest of the electric system has been left untouched.
All of the autonomy is implemented in the External ECU, i.e. sensor information is
collected and fused to get the world perception. With the sensor data and the world
perception as input the External ECU calculates a route. To execute the calculated
route the External ECU sends speed and deceleration requests to the trucks electrical
system via the interface. The Scania ECU receives the requests from the External
ECU, repacks and gates the messages to the correct part of the SESAMM electrical
system. In this case the CAN messages are gated to the power train that executes the
requests from the External ECU. A modern truck is from the start equipped with a lot
of sensors and large bulk of information is available. Some of this information is useful
for the External ECU to get a precise control of the truck. An example of this would be
the trucks speed sensor. This useful information is repacked and gated to the External
ECU by the Scania ECU.

5.3.1

Communication
Scania ECU

In addition to the standard tasks of the Scania ECU additional tasks and logics have
been added. Looking at this specific case the Scania ECU’s main tasks are to
1. Collect control requests from the External ECU, repack those and gate to the
driveline
2. Send feedback from the implemented logic to the External ECU
3. Repack and gate useful CAN signals to External ECU, for example vehicle speed,
engine speed etc.

5.3.2

Messages and signals

This section will provide a brief overview over the CAN communication in the interface.
In the interface there are two specialized CAN messages which are used to deliver
information back and fourth.
When the External ECU wants to send requests to the truck it uses CAN message that
can be called the External control message. The information contained by the message
is:
• Vehicle speed request
• Vehicle acceleration request
• Vehicle gear request
For the External ECU to gain feedback from the Scania ECU there is a CAN message
called the Feedback message. The feedback message contains the following information:
• State
• Control active
The content of the above described CAN message is not as self explanatory as the
content of the external control message. The state informs the External ECU the
current state of the state machine that decides when the External ECU can take control
and when for example the safe stop is activated. The control active is merely an
indication whether the External ECU is in control over the truck or not.

10

5.4

Logic

To enable the autonomous driving with the External ECU there are a number of conditions that needs to be fulfilled for the external control interface to function properly.
There is also built in safety features to prevent the vehicle from moving uncontrolled
or to prevent requests that could damage the truck. An example would be if the engine
stops when the vehicle is rolling or if acceleration and braking has been requested for
too long period of time during standstill. To clarify which conditions that needs to be
fulfilled at what time the state diagram of the built in logic can be viewed in Figure 5.4.
All of the logic that is described in this section is implemented in the Scania ECU.

Figure 5.2: External control states

5.4.1

Description of states

Manual Driving
The vehicle always start in manual driving mode, since in this research study it’s
important to have control of the situation. If External ECU wants to request external
control a number of conditions must be fulfilled to allow for the state to switch. For
example the vehicle speed must be equal to zero and driver controls must be functional.
When all of the conditions are fulfilled the vehicle goes to next state.

11

Under external control
When the vehicle enters the Under external control state it will start to follow the
requests from the External ECU. As said before the External ECU utilizes speed and
deceleration requests to make the truck move as intended. In this state the Scania ECU
analysis the requests made by the External ECU to determine if the interface is used
according to the rules. If the Scania ECU finds signs of misuse the Safe stop will be
activated.
Driver override
As said in Section 5.1 a driver is always prioritized over the external control. When
under external control and the vehicle detects that a driver wants to taker over, the
vehicle goes to the Driver override state. There are a number of ways for a driver to
take control of the truck, for example stepping on the acceleration pedal or engaging
the brakes.
Safe stop
The most important safety feature in the interface is the Safe stop. When the external
control is active the Scania ECU analyse the communication with the External ECU to
determine if the interface is used in the right way. Scania wants to be absolutely certain
that no accidents occur due to a misunderstanding in the communication or misuse of
the interface. If a deviation is found in the CAN communication or if the External
ECU goes silent during active control the safe stop will immediately be initiated. The
safe stop will also be activated if the engine stops while the truck is still rolling. For
the vehicle to be able to return to external control a driver must take control over the
vehicle and go through a safety procedure to proceed to the next state.

12

Chapter 6
Analysis
Up to here this report has been a description of what the interface is and how it works,
from here on the report will move towards a qualitative perspective where improvements
and changes will be discussed. This chapter will also carefully breach the scope of the
thesis to answer the question stated in Section 1.2 and discuss if and then how SESAMM
must change to support the functionality of the improved interface.

6.1

The improved interface

Today the interface can handle simple requests of goal speed and deceleration, this
might be enough to get the truck driving autonomously but from the external controls
perspective this might be a bit sparse. One can easily understand that neither the
acceleration or the deceleration will be instant, but the external control has no idea
how large the delay will be or how the driveline responds in different situations. I
think Scania needs to take a larger responsibility of how the driveline is controlled
towards the interface. In other words more logic must be implemented further down in
the hierarchy. A future interface would need to supply a better ability to control the
driveline in a more precise way. Also the number of available control request might also
need to be enlarged, The speed request of today might be suitable when the truck is
driving longer distances where its more appropriate to request a goal speed. In tight
spaces a more thorough control is needed, therefore a better type of acceleration request
is needed. It’s hard to say what would be the ultimate solution in the general case,
but the availability of a speed request as a ramp or perhaps as a parabolic function
would give a better starting point for the external control. An other solution would be
to utilize a distance dependent speed request, where the external control could require
a speed for a limited distance. An example of this would be “drive 10 m in 5 km/h”.
If one wants the interface to be truly general and be applicable in many areas I think
the interface need to provide several different types of requests for example controlling
the vehicle speed.
In Chapter 3 the vehicle configuration is described along with the modifications needed
and one can see that the amount of compatible hardware is limited. In a commercially
viable interface the ability for the customer to choose a configuration that fulfills their
needs must be preserved. For example in some autonomous applications an Opticruise
gearbox might be more suitable than the now supported Allison. The thought of a truly
modular product system must be continued on to autonomous trucks as well.
13

In the present interface the previously described safe stop functionality demands a
driver to physically get to the truck and go through a safety procedure if the safe stop
is activated. In this project Scania wanted to make sure that no accidents happened
because of the interface and the handling of it. At this early state it is the right way to
go, but in a future version of the interface I think that a two part procedure must come
before human interaction is needed on site. Firstly, an automatic diagnosis procedure
should evaluate why the safe stop was initiated and decide if the vehicle can continue to
drive autonomously. If the automatic diagnosis decides that the vehicle can not directly
go back to external control it would be beneficiary if a driver or technician remotely
connects to the truck to do additional checks. If both of these steps fail the vehicle
should demand for physical human interaction.

14

6.2

Suggested changes to future version of SESAMM

In Section 6.1 the improved interface has been defined, but which changes needs to be
made to SESAMM in order to achieve compability? As I see it there are two types
of problems when it comes to implementing this future interface. Firstly, the future
interface requires functionality which are not supported by the different systems in the
driveline at this specific time. The second problem or more correctly requirement is
that new logic needs to be created to enable the new features.
To enable more and new types of requests one must determine that the affected systems support the requested functionality. For example the engine ECU must have the
ability to control the engine with enough accuracy to make linear or quadratic speeds
requests possible. When it comes to distance dependent speed requests it’s possible
that the sensors become the limiting factor. If one imagines when a distance dependent
speed request would be used, one can come to the conclusion that accuracy might be
important. If a mining truck example is considered, imagine the truck close to the edge
of the dumping site where the load is to be unloaded. Then the request could be “Drive
0.55 m in 1 km/h”, if the accuracy in the response to this request fails catastrophic
consequences could be the result. To make sure that the needed accuracy is achieved
both hardware and software changes might be needed. Enough accurate sensors might
do the trick on it’s own but combining two or more sensors in a sensor fusion manner
could be a solution.
Let’s look back to the question stated in Section 1.2 and pay some attention to the
constraints supplied with the problem definition. They stated that SESAMM could
neither change in complexity nor in cost, so how do we add functionality while under
these constraints? I think the key is to separate what is needed for autonomy purposes
and what is used by every other truck. In other words continue to think in modules.
First let’s define what parts of SESAMM the constraints are valid for. The part of
SESAMM that’s implemented in every truck in other words the core functionality can
not increase in cost and complexity, but a truck equipped with the interface could be
both more expensive and have a more complex electrical system than the regular truck.
But the core system must be the same, there should only be an interface add on. The
problem then comes down to how to add enough functionality in the core electrical
system to enable the advance functions of the interface without the core electrical
system increases in complexity and cost. Some of the functionality needed might be
useful for other implementations apart from the interface and may be implemented as
a part of the core functionality, otherwise they belong to the interface add on.

15

Chapter 7
Conclusions
A discussion about what changes that would be relevant in a future version of the
interface and SESAMM has been presented above. Now is the time to decide what conclusions could be drawn from that discussion. If one look upon the interface and what
is discussed in Section 6.1 it can be concluded that the interface needs to provide more
types of requests to support the use of the interface in many applications. Furthermore, the amount of supported systems/hardware needs to be increased to support the
customers ability to configure their truck for their specific need. As a final conclusion
for the interface I think that the safe stop functionality presented in Section 5.4 and
discussed in Section 6.1 needs to be further developed to make it more flexible and less
driver dependent.
I’s hard to make specific conclusions when it comes to SESAMM since that lies beyond the scope of this thesis. Nevertheless I can make some more general conclusions.
The thought of using modules must continue and the logic that is exclusive to trucks
equipped with the interface needs to be separated from the logic that is implemented in
every other truck. Also the implementation of the interface and more advanced requests
will require further development of the systems the interface is depending upon. It’s
also hard to determine if this kind of development would affect the core functionality
of SESAMM or if it could be exclusive to the interface add on.
