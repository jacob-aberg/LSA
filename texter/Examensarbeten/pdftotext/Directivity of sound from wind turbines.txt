Abstract
In the present paper, a study on the directivity of sound from a wind turbine has been conducted.
The aim of the study is to investigate the horizontal sound radiation pattern through a field study
compared to a noise prediction. The benefit of the results may be used to optimize the output effect
from the wind turbine while the guidelines for noise levels at nearby residential areas still are met.
The complete directivity pattern around the wind turbine was investigated by performing emission
measurements around the wind turbine from a method described in IEC 61400-11 Wind turbine
generator systems – Part 11: Acoustic noise measurement technique.
Furthermore, the dominant sound source from the wind turbine, the turbulent boundary layer
trailing edge noise, and the frequency range where it is dominating has also been scrutinized.
The results show that the dipole character of the trailing edge noise has an impact on the entire
horizontal radiation pattern from the wind turbine.
From a field study it was found that there was a distinguishable directivity of the sound.
On a distance of 125 m from the wind turbine the sound pressure level in the crosswind direction of
the wind turbine is close to 3 dBA less than the sound pressure level in the downwind direction of the
wind turbine when the wind speed is 8 m/s at a height of 10 m. The difference between other
directions compared to the downwind direction is less significant.
This could be utilized to optimize the power output, however the difference in sound level is
relatively small but the advantage for power output have to be quantified before a conclusion of the
benefits can be made.

Sammanfattning
I föreliggande rapport, har en studie om ljudets direktivitet från vindkraftverk utförts.
Syftet med studien är att undersöka den horisontella ljudutstrålningen genom en fältstudie som
jämförs med en prediktion av bullernivån. Resultatet kan möjligtvis användas för att optimera den
producerade effekten från vindkraftverk samtidigt som riktlinjerna för bullernivåerna vid närliggande
bostadsområden hålls uppfyllda.
Ljudets direktivitet runt vindkraftverket undersöktes genom att utföra emissionsmätningar runt
vindkraftverket med en metod som beskrivs i IEC 61400-11 Wind turbine generator systems – Part
11: Acoustic noise measurement technique.
Den dominerande ljudkällan från vindkraftverket är ljudet som uppstår nära rotorbladets spets när
turbulens som uppstår längs med rotorbladet rör sig över bladets bakkant (Turbulent boundary layer
trailing edge noise). Frekvensområdet där det ljudet dominerar har undersökts noggrant på grund av
ljudets starka direktivitet och att det är den dominerande ljudkällan från moderna vindkraftverk.
Resultaten visar en direktivitet av dipolär karaktär vilket tyder på att ljudet som uppstår vid bladets
bakkant har en inverkan på hela det horisontella ljudutstrålningsmönstret från vindkraftverket.
Från en fältstudie fann man att det fanns en tydlig direktivitet på ljudet.
På ett avstånd av 125 m från vindkraftverket var ljudtrycksnivån i sidvinds riktning av vindkraftverket
nära 3 dBA lägre, när vindhastigheten var 8 m/s på 10 meters höjd, än ljudtrycksnivån var nedströms
om vindkraftverket i vindriktningen.
Skillnader mellan andra riktningar jämfört med nedströms om vindkraftverket är mindre signifikanta.
Detta skulle kunna användas för att optimera effekten, dock är skillnaden i ljudnivån relativt liten
men fördelen som kan göras i uteffekt kan inte uteslutas innan den blivit kvantifierad.

Introduction

1 Introduction
1.1 Scope
Wind turbines are an environmentally friendly and renewable source of energy, which are two
important factors for the future of energy production. But the noise from wind turbines is often
perceived as annoying and affects residents in the vicinity.
The guidelines for which sound pressure levels from wind turbines that are allowed varies between
countries, but is a main concern for manufacturer, owner and people living nearby the wind turbine.
A guideline issued by the Swedish National Environmental Protection Agency (Naturvårdsverket)
states that the noise levels at the facades on buildings of nearby residential areas should be below 40
dB(A) when the wind speed is 8 m/s at 10 meters height [1].
Relevance: A way to ensure that this guideline is followed is to calculate a prediction on how the
noise will affect the surrounding area around the wind farm before construction and then follow up
by performing emission or imission measurements to investigate the sound power level that the
wind farm emits. The results of these predictions and measurements can then be used to support the
building permits or be used to determine how much the wind turbine will be allowed to be active.
Therefore sound propagation is an important part when planning construction of wind turbines
However, the sound from wind turbines is not radiating equally strong in all directions propagating
away from the wind turbine. There are actually several sound sources with different characteristics
of both tone and sound radiation pattern.
When measurements of sound from wind turbines are performed, one of the most important
parameters is the sound power level, which is the acoustic power radiated from the source.
This is measured downwind of the wind turbine, assuming that the sound comes from an omnidirectional point source. This means that directivity is neglected.
Sound power level is measured in accordance with standard IEC 61400-11 Wind turbine generator
systems – Part 11: Acoustic noise measurement technique [2]. The standard includes an option to
measure how the noise level varies in different directions from the sound source.
This is performed to determine the sound radiation pattern also known as directivity of the sound.
Benefits: By knowing how the sound radiates from a wind turbine, one can regulate the turbines
setup depending on directivity and direction to nearby residential areas to optimize power output
while still fulfilling the conditions in different guidelines.
1.2 Objectives
The objectives of this master thesis are to:
 Investigate how the sound pressure level varies in different directions from the wind turbine
and what the consequences may be.
 Program a prediction code for the sound radiation pattern to compare with measurements.
 Discuss how the sound radiation pattern can be used to optimize the power output from a
wind turbine while keeping the sound level to the limit of 40 dB(A) at the facades on buildings
of nearby residential areas.

Introduction
1.3 Limitations
The study has been limited to certain restrictions:
 This thesis is focusing on horizontal directivity, which is according to the measurement
method described in standard 61400-11 Wind turbine generator systems – Part 11: Acoustic
noise measurement techniques. Vertical directivity is not included in the field study.
 Results of the measurements will be limited to one wind turbine and to the parameters that
apply in that specific time, such as turbine mode, angle of attack and rotation speeds,
temperature, wind speed, surrounding environment, season specifics instead of a general
view over the year.
 The measurements are limited to a shorter time-span during daytime, thus variations during
the day, such as stratification of temperature could not be observed. However a
measurement during night was also performed so the comparison between day and night is
conducted.
 Directivity is frequency dependent and the perceived loudness of the sound source will vary
with the distance between observer and blade. However, in this study the total noise will be
investigated which means a minute average of the equivalent sound pressure level covering
several revolutions of the rotor will be studied.
 The wind turbine noise prediction is limited to turbulent boundary layer trailer edge noise
which is the dominant sound source of a wind turbine and optionally separation stall noise.

2 Theory
This chapter intends to give some perspective about sound from wind power. It describes the
fundamental acoustic, sound sources, different parameters that can affect the sound, measurement
methods used to observe sound and important information from the literature study.

2.1 Fundamental acoustics
The unit used to measure sound is called Bel. It is a value based on a ratio between a power and the
reference value of that powers unit. In acoustics, Bel is too large of a unit and instead you use a tenth
of a Bel called decibel according to och vibrationer (Sound and Vibrations) [3].
The most common ways to measure sound is based on either changes of pressure in the air, the
intensity of particles in the air or the total acoustic power.
The human ear can hear frequencies between 4Hz and 20 kHz. In order to mimic the ear's perception
capabilities, a filter that reduces the influence of low frequencies can be used. The most common
filter to use is A-weighting, with the unit dB(A), but there are also B and C-weighting [4].
2.1.2 Sound power Level
Sound power level is a unit which is used to obtain the acoustic power radiated from a sound source.
The instantaneous acoustic effect that propagates through a surface S with the normal vector n
according to Ljud och vibrationer (Sound and Vibrations) [3] is defined as:
[W]

(2)

Equation 2: Sound power level
Where

is the sound pressure [Pa]
is the particle velocity [m/s]
From this basic mechanical formula the sound intensity and sound pressure level can be derived.
Equation 2 and 3 are obtained from Ljud och vibrationer [3].

Where

c

is the speed of the sound [m/s].
is the time averaged sound effect level [W].
is the distance between the sound sources to the observer [m].

These units are the most common when quantifying sound.

Theory
2.1.3 Sound propagation
The sound pressure level decrease when sound propagates through the atmosphere, because the
sound energy is distributed in a wider area. This is known as geometric dispersion.
The spherical spreading of the sound pressure level is reduced by 6 dB(A) as the distance is doubled.
Sound propagation is affected by wind and air temperature which varies with height and the ground
damping influence and roughness [3].
2.1.4 Directivity of sound
The directivity of sound means that the sound level emitted from a source varies in strength
depending on the different directions from the sound source.
Thus, the sound has a directional component and consequently a sound source can be considered as
omni-directional or directional according to Vargas [5].
If the sound is directional, the strength of the noise level may vary in different directions from the
sound source, this can be represented as a pattern of sound radiation, also called the directivity of
the sound. If it is omni-directional, the sound source radiates energy equally in all directions.
Directivity is measured in either a Directivity index in decibels or as a dimensionless value Q.
An example of an omni-directional source would be a balloon that pops, it emits sound equally in all
directions. This represents a Q value of 1.
Another example of directivity of sound is when you try to be heard at long distances outside and
you cup your hands around your mouth to increase the directivity. This increases the Q value.
In this study, aerodynamic sources from the rotor blades are mainly investigated and these sources
which are induced by flow are expected to have a dipole character of directivity.
In the standard IEC 61400-11 Wind turbine generator systems – Part 11: Acoustic noise measurement
technique [2] a method to describe the directivity of the sound is the directivity index.
This method evaluates the difference in sound pressure level between the measurement points by
comparing the sound pressure levels with the reference point and accounting for different distance.

Theory
2.1.5 Lighthill’s equation
To explain aerodynamic noise which is sound generated by flow a formula containing the classical
wave equation (left hand side of eq.4) together with the flow induced source term (right hand side of
eq.4) is used. This formula is better known as Lighthill’s equation according to Lighthill [6].
(4)
Equation 4: Lighthill’s equation
Where
c

is the speed of the sound [m/s]
is the nabla operator which in Cartesian system equals (

x

is a Cartesian co-ordinate

u

is the flow velocity for i,j=1, 2, 3. The factor between ui,uj is called
Lighthill’s turbulence stress tensor which is important in the generation
of noise that is dependent on the flow conditions considered. [6]

For a wind turbine, which has rotating blades with solid surfaces and sharp trailing edges the source
term can be modified according to reference [7]. Due to the motion of the rotor the sound
generation will also be modified with a Doppler-shift that modifies the frequency and can also cause
changes in the directivity according to Howe [8].

2.2 Noise from wind turbines
2.2.1 Aerodynamic noise
Aerodynamic noise is generated when the rotor blade passes through the air according to Wagner [9]
As the blade moves the sound source form a dipole characteristic of directivity around the blade.
The sound is perceived as a swishing or hissing sound and is of broadband character [5].
For the modern wind turbines it is normal that the aerodynamic noise generated at the blades is the
dominant sound from the wind turbine and these sounds are described by Lighthill’s equation.
The impact of noise characteristics is the angle of attack, blade shape, blade tip velocity and
turbulence in the air [5]. The dominant aerodynamic noise from the blades is seen in Fig.1 from [10].

Fig.1. The dominant sound source as pictured by an acoustic camera [10]

5

Theory
2.2.1.1 Airfoil self-noise
The dominating sound source from a wind turbine is the aerodynamic sound sources.
The airfoil self-noise that is most prominent is the trailing edge noise pictured in Fig.2.
The noise originates from the interaction between turbine blade and turbulence from its own
boundary layer and wake, it is generated when the boundary layer moves over the trailing edge [4].
As described in figure 2 [5], the scattering from the vortical disturbances on the boundary layer
propagates (from left to right in fig.2) into acoustic waves at the trailing edge of an airfoil which
causes turbulent boundary layer trailing-edge noise (TBL-TE) [5].

Fig.2. Sources for aerodynamic noise at the airfoil [5]
The TBL noise is also seen as a prominent source of noise by the acoustic camera in figure 1.
The dominant sound originates close to the tip, but not at the very edge. According to Oerlemans
[10, 19] practically all downward radiated blade noise is produced on the blades downward
movement. There are several other aerodynamic sound sources that origin at different locations of
the blade. Such as separation-stall noise, tip vortex formation noise and vortex shedding from the
laminar boundary layer according to Vargas [5]. However, in this study the main focus is on trailing
edge noise and in some extent separation-stall noise for high angles of attack of the blade.
2.2.1.2 Inflow turbulence noise
Low frequency noise due to inflow turbulence occurs because of modulations in the lifting force of
the blade. The reason for this is the incoming turbulence which causes changes in flow speed and
angle of attack. Inflow turbulence can also be the source of higher frequency noise if there is an
interaction between turbulence and the leading edge according to Lowson [11].
2.2.1.3 Low frequency noise from aerodynamic sources
If the rotor is positioned downwind of the tower, it creates a strong low-frequency thumping sound
when the blade passes the tower. Wind turbines with the rotor positioned downwind are very
unusual in the current situation [11].
2.2.2 Mechanical noise
The mechanical noise is not as noticeable as the aerodynamic noise from modern wind turbines
because the sound insulation of the mechanical components of the assembly is highly developed.
However, there can be failure or wear of the gear and fittings which can cause a tonal sound [11].

2.3 Environmental effects
The environmental effects may have great influence on the results of a measurement.
The right wind speeds, weather conditions and amount of background noise is required for a
standardised measurement according to the standard [2].
The measurements that have been performed for this study were emission measurements, as the
distance between point of measurement and sound source is relatively short compared to an
imission measurement. Therefore the environmental effect is not as prominent as it would have
been for an imission measurement.

6

Theory
2.3.1 Refraction
The phenomenon that sound waves can change direction in different ways depending on
environmental effects mentioned in 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 is called refraction. Refraction is affected by the
speed of the sound which is influenced by both wind speed gradient and temperature gradient [12].
The temperature gradients effect on the sound waves described in 2.3.2 are shown in figure 3 [13].

Fig.3. The refraction of sound waves due to refraction at (a) positive temperature gradient and (b)
negative temperature gradient [13].
2.3.2 Wind speed gradient
The wind speed gradient is the variation of wind speed depending on altitude.
As the wind gets closer to the ground and gets reflected and absorbed by the ground surface, the
wind speed is slowed down by the ground roughness. The wind speed may also increase in speed due
to layers of air with relatively high temperature.
For sound propagation downstream of the wind turbine, the wind speed will be added to the sound
waves normal propagation speed.
A high ground roughness will cause higher wind speed gradient. The increase of gradient will cause
the sound waves to refract downward towards the ground when propagating downstream.
Upstream of the wind turbine, the sound waves will refract up, which causes the sound waves to hit
the ground surface with a flat angle, increasing the magnitude of the ground attenuation.
Due to this, one can expect lower sound levels upstream than downstream.
There might even be a sound shadow which damps the sound even further according to the report
from Naturvårdsverket [13]. Examples of these two phenomena can also be seen in figure 4 [14].

Fig. 4. The sound propagation around a wind turbine with the presence of a wind speed gradient [14]

7

Theory
2.3.3 Temperature gradient
Temperature varies with height over ground due to the suns height over the horizon and the amount
of cloudiness. With increasing temperature the speed of sound is also increased [13].
A negative temperature gradient is when the air temperature will decrease with height over ground.
This occurs for example on clear days and will cause the sound waves to refract upwards which in
turn causes decreased of the sound levels as one move away from the sound source.
Furthermore a negative temperature gradient correlates to high wind speeds at ground level, high
turbulence factor and low vertical wind gradient [13].
A temperature inversion is when the air temperature increases with height over ground.
This happens on a clear night when the wind is still and will cause the sound waves to refract
downwards which in turn could cause the sound to be audible on long distances.
Furthermore a temperature inversion causes low wind speeds at ground, low turbulence factor and
high vertical wind gradient [13].
At certain circumstances, there may be height inversion, where the temperature decreases with
height at first, and then starts increasing through a higher air layer. If this occurs, sound waves can
propagate over large distances with little damping [13].
The wind is influencing the sound from wind turbines more than temperature, and the influence of
the temperature gradient is mainly when the wind speed is low [13].
2.3.4 Air absorption
The air absorption is influenced by frequency, humidity, air pressure, distance between source and
receiver and temperature. The air absorption has greater effect for sound with high frequency and
long propagation distances according to the report by Naturvårdsverket [13].
The air absorption is not accounted for in IEC 61400-11 Wind turbine generator systems – Part 11:
Acoustic noise measurement technique [2]. This will cause the sound power level at frequencies over
1 kHz to be underestimated. However, the difference is less than 1 dB for A-weighted sound power
level [15].
2.6 Background noise
When measuring sound from wind turbines, it is required to separate the background noise from the
wind turbines noise according to the standard [2]. This means all the wind turbines in the vicinity
have to be parked to focus and measure the sounds that take place at the location in exception of
the wind turbines.
Background noise is divided into two subcategories, firstly natural background noise such as wind,
animals, waves and noise from vegetation and secondly community noise such as traffic and
industries according to Appelqvist [16].
Background noise varies during the day and due to the temperature inversion in the evening the
wind speed at ground is decreased which also decreases the background noise which in turn give rise
to a more prominent wind turbine noise as it is less masked according to Appel [17].

Theory

2.7 Measuring methods
2.7.1 Noise emission
To measure noise emission of a wind turbine, the method described in 61400-11 Wind turbine
generator systems – Part 11: Acoustic noise measurement techniques [2] is the preferred course of
action. [2]
Measurements are performed at a distance from the base of the wind turbine which is equal to the
height plus the radius of the rotor. The microphone is placed upon a measuring board lying on the
ground. The reason is to minimize the wind induced noise and to create a uniform reflection from
site to site due to the acoustically hard surface of the ground board.
The reflections from the ground are also negligible so the ground effect is not taken to consideration.
The measurement point should be downstream of the wind turbine in the direction of the wind and
it is optional to add three more measurement points in other directions to determine directivity.
By following this procedure the sound power level can be determined in relation to different wind
speeds. [2]
2.7.2 Noise imission
Noise imission measurement should simulate the sound pressure level at the point of the receiver
i.e. the facades of nearby buildings. When measuring noise imission, the wind turbine noise is
treated as community background noise. Therefore measuring noise imission of a wind turbine is
more complex than noise emission, because the natural background noise can be difficult to
distinguish from the wind turbine noise. For both emission and imission there may be noise
generated by wind at the microphone, sound induced from wind flowing through adjacent trees,
traffic, aircrafts, industries, animal or human activities and streams or waves. [2]
However, for imission measurements which are further away from the wind turbine, the sound
pressure level from the wind turbine can be exceeded by the background noise.

2.8 Wind turbine structure
A wind turbine can be divided into five major parts according to Vargas [5]. This can be seen in fig. 5.

Theory

2.9 Wind turbine noise prediction
A wind turbine noise prediction for aerodynamic sound sources have been implemented to compare
the experimental results with simulations performed in Matlab® (Appendix D). The sound sources
that have been accounted for in the prediction code are the aerodynamic sources from the blades.
The simulation is based on a code from the report Airfoil self-noise and prediction [18].
The simulation is a simplified noise prediction where the directivity functions for the trailing
boundary layer noise for high frequencies eq.5 and optionally low frequencies eq.6 have been
calculated. The turbulent layer trailing edge noise and separation stall noise have identical scaling
laws [5]. However, for separation stall noise eq.6 should be used for the directivity factor.
In equation 5,
corresponds to the observer positions around the wind turbine.
The sound pressure levels for suction side and pressure side have been calculated according to
equation 7, 8 and 9 over a revolution of the rotor for one blade and are then multiplied for the
number of blades. The dimensions of the wind turbine, general environmental conditions and mean
wind speed from the field study have been implemented in the simulation.
Limitations:
The noise prediction is theoretical and will over estimate the attenuation in crosswind plane.
In reality, the sound pressure level will not decrease as much as predicted because other sound
sources such as background noise and mechanical noise will still be present.
In the reports described in 2.10.3 and 2.10.5 the theoretical decrease in the crosswind have been
adjusted with and overridden, adjusting the observer position to a location not critical for eq.5 and 6.
The simplification that has been included is a general background sound source that increases the
overall sound pressure levels, causing the crosswind decrease to be more realistic seen in Fig. 6a, 6b
The blades have been divided into segments, however the sound sources have not been applied to
the actual segment where the sound source originates. Equations 5 to 10 are found in [5].

2.10 Literature study
2.10.1 Method for literature study
In the beginning of this master thesis a literature study was performed to achieve the knowledge
required. The focus of the literature study was on the sound propagation of noise from wind
turbines, wind turbine noise predictions, directivity of different sound sources and measurement
methods for wind turbines.
The literature included relevant standards, project reports about the topic, reports including
directivity and semi-empirical methods for evaluation of vertical directivity.
2.10.1.1 Query method
In search of literature in the field, material has been found through searches in technical databases.
Particularly ScienceDirect, Scopus, ETDE, Web of Science, Compendex, NTIS and Inspec have been
used. Even Internet-based search engines have been used to some extent.
2.10.2 Conclusion of literature study
The conclusion that can be drawn from earlier work about directivity of noise from wind turbines
states that there is a reduction of sound radiation in the crosswind direction in comparison to the
other directions from the wind turbine. Measurements upstream of the tower against the wind
direction also tend to have lower sound levels compared to the downstream measurement point due
to refraction.
To give an insight on the problem the following chapters are summaries of earlier work in the field.

2.10.3 Prediction of wind turbine noise and validation against experiment, S.Oerlemans
In report [10] a semi-empirical prediction method for trailing edge noise from wind turbines has been
tested. The prediction code that needs the blade geometry and the turbine operating conditions was
compared to measurements by an acoustic array and directivity measurements and the prediction
showed the same characteristics as the results of the measurements.
The report shows that noise that is emitted to the ground was produced when the blade of the rotor
was moving downward. This is due to trailing edge noise directivity and convective amplification.
By applying the prediction code to calculate noise footprints, it is shown that for cross-wind
directions the average level is lower than in upwind and downwind directions.

Fig. 7. Measured and predicted directivity of a wind turbine [19]
In figure 7 from Location and quantification of noise sources on a wind turbine [19] the directivity in
the far field for a wind turbine is shown with sound pressure levels relative to the reference point as
a function of observer location.
The figure shows how the overall A-weighted sound pressure level summed between 250-800 Hz is
different depending on the angle that one is facing the wind turbine.
The frequency range is chosen to 250-800 Hz because the trailing edge noise is located in the same
frequency range. This study shows that acoustic measurements on a circle around the turbine
constitute a measurement of the complete trailing edge noise directivity function, including
directions outside the plane normal to the trailing edge.
There are eight clusters of experimental values with the angle depending on the angle between the
measurement position and the direction that the wind turbine rotor is pointing.
The yaw angles are clustered because measurement positions are fixed while the yaw angle changes
to align the blades perpendicular to the wind direction.
It is apparent that the experimental values are fitting the simulated values and that there is a
difference of 8 dB depending on direction.
The reason that the upwind sound levels are slightly higher is because of the convective factor in
equation 7 (Chapter 5, p.10). This is because when the blade azimuth angle is 90° the inverted blade
flow velocity points upwind.

Theory
2.10.4 Low frequency noise-sound power measurement method, B. Søndergaaard
In the report Noise Sound power measurement method from DELTA a measurement of directivity
according to 61400-11 Wind turbine generator systems – Part 11: Acoustic noise measurement
techniques have been performed.
This report mentions vertical directivity on a 22 m high wind turbine from a measurement made by
DELTA, where it was up to 5 dB difference in an octave band. The highest sound power levels were
measured between 30° and 50° in angle of attack between measurement point and sound source.
The report also states that air absorption may affect up to 1 dB on the A-weighted sound power level
at frequencies over 1 kHz. [15]
In the report it is concluded that directivity is calculated to be low at low frequencies on new wind
turbines due to high wave length. If the purpose of the measurement is to investigate how the
nearby residential areas are affected then measurement according to standard [2] are acceptable but
a secondary wind screen should be included if the insertion loss is calculated. The report
recommends that the reduction of sound power levels over 1 kHz due to air absorption should be
included in the calculation [15]. The report also includes a method to calculate insertion loss for
secondary wind screen in Appendix A of the report [15]. This method which simulates the inclination
angle of a wind turbine have been used for the calibration of the secondary wind screens that were
used in the field study of the present paper, with the exception of the reference measurement point.
2.10.5 Wind turbine noise prediction, Luís Filipe da Conceição Vargas
In this report [5], a wind turbine noise prediction method have been developed and compared to
other predictions. A problem when developing a prediction code is that the directivity functions
approach zero in the crosswind direction of a wind turbine. In order to overcome this unrealistic
situation, this method adds a value of 0.2 m to the observer position at 90° and 270° This forces the
directivity terms to have higher contribution in the over-predicted values in the rotor plane.
Because the blades are twisted, the dipole pattern of directivity is shaped into a non-symmetric
form. This is a consequence of the blade’s pitch which leads the trailing edge backward and the
leading edge forward. Furthermore, because the trailing edge is positioned behind the rotor plane
the upwind positions will suffer greater noise abatement compare to downwind positions.
Figure 8.a and figure 8.b from reference [5] is an example on how this can change the directivity
pattern.

Method

3 Method
To determine the directivity a method described in IEC 61400-11 Wind turbine generator systems –
Part 11: Acoustic noise measurement technique is conducted by placing sound level meters in a circle
on the ground around the wind turbine.
By measuring the sound pressure levels at these measurement points at wind speeds in a range
considered of interest, and then reducing those levels for the background noise and difference in
distance from the sound source, the horizontal directivity can be determined as a comparison
between different observer locations. [2]
The measurement setup is according to the emission measurement method described in the
standard [2]. An emission measurement is conducted by measuring a sound source on a relatively
short distance. The microphone is place on a ground board to create a uniform reflection from site to
site due to the acoustically hard surface of the ground board. A primary small wind screen and a
secondary larger wind screen are placed upon the microphone to reduced wind induced sound at the
microphone.
In addition to the standard measurement setup, two measurement points have been included for the
purpose to get higher resolution of measurement point separation in a quarter circles relative to a
circle around the wind turbine. The decreased distance between the measurement points relative to
the standard setup provides an increased resolution of the directivity pattern.
The measurement points are synchronized with the wind turbine and then the sound pressure levels
are recorded every second. These sound pressure levels are then averaged into equivalent sound
pressure levels for every minute and then correlated to the wind speed measured with wind mast,
anemometer at the wind turbines nacelle and calculation from the power curve of the output effect
from the wind turbine. The wind speed is then calculated from the nacelle method and the K-factor
method described in the standard [2]. The total noise of the wind turbine is measured with the rest
of the wind turbines in the wind farm parked.
The equivalent sound pressure levels are corrected for the background noise at equal wind speeds.
To get the correct values at specific wind speed, a regression analysis for the total noise level and
background noise is conducted. The background noise at the location is measured with all the wind
turbines in the wind farm parked.
During the regression analysis, abnormal sounds are excluded from the data series, such as animal
activity, vehicles or other background noises which occurs only in short sessions.
Due to the fact that the measurement points are spread out over a large area, some sound sources
may be audible only for one measurement point. For a correct comparison, the third octave bands
affected by such noise have been decreased by an amount that is calculated from an average
difference between the affected measurement point and the reference measurement point.
To establish the directivity pattern, a comparison between the results from the field study and the
predicted values from a simulation is performed for verification.
The simulation is based on a wind turbine noise prediction code from the report Airfoil self-noise and
prediction [18] which is the basis of the prediction codes from the reports described in 2.9.3 and
2.9.5. This prediction assumes only aerodynamic noise, which however is the dominating sound
source. The simulation which is executed in Matlab® can be seen in Appendix D

All the instruments have been calibrated according to SS-EN ISO/IEC 17025 the date of calibration
can be seen in the instruments log from ÅF- Sound and vibration.
4.2.2 Ground board
On the measurement point a ground board is placed with the microphone placed in the center.
The board should have a diameter of at least 1 m and a thickness of 12 mm according to [2].
The setup can be seen from the field study in fig.9 and according to standard in fig.10 [2].
With the measurement point on the ground, the effects of wind noise and interference phenomena
are reduced, but it also means that the vertical directivity cannot be measured.
The sound pressure level shall be adjusted by +6 dB because the surface is acoustically hard. [2]

Field study

Furthermore advantages of using a large board are:
 A reduction of the influence of reflected sound from vertical surfaces behind the board.
 Improved signal-to-noise ratio for the ambient sound sources behind the board.
 Improved signal-to-noise ratio due to reduced influence of background noise from turbulent
wind around the microphone.
4.2.3 Microphone
The microphone should have a maximum diaphragm diameter of 13 mm.
The tilt angle between the ground board and direction of the microphone against the rotor hub
should be between 25 ° - 40 °. This can be adjusted by the distance from the turbine. [2]
These conditions were satisfied during the measurement.
4.2.4 Sound level meter
The sound level meters that were used, Norsonic 140 and Norsonic 118, fulfilled the requirements
from the standard [2]. This includes the conditions on microphone membrane and third-octave
analyzer.
4.2.5 Windscreen
The windscreen consisted of a half-transparent spherical cell of the foam with a diameter of about 90
mm, which is centered on the diaphragm of the microphone.
A secondary wind screen was placed symmetrically over the smaller windscreen.
The dimensions should be at least a diameter of 450 mm, covered with a layer of open cell foam with
a thickness of 13 mm to 25 mm and a porosity of 4 to 8 pores per 10 mm [2].
These conditions were fulfilled for the wind screens used in the field study.
The influence of the secondary wind screen is shown in Appendix C.
4.2.6 Wind mast
The wind mast that was used, Windsonic wind meter 1405, fulfilled the conditions in the standard [2]

Fig.11. Allowed region for wind mast. [2]
Figure 11 which is from the standard [2] shows the allowed region for the wind mast.
The wind mast was placed in a direct position upwind of the wind turbine, with a distance three
times the diameter of the wind turbine rotor away from the tower. This was in the allowed region.
4.2.7 Distance meter
To measure the distance from the measurement points to the wind turbine a binocular laser meter
with accuracy according to standard [2]. Distance to base and hub of the wind turbine was measured.

17

Field study

4.3 Measurement method
According to standard [2] the procedure to determine the directivity is to investigate the sound
pressure level as a function of wind speed in several measurement points.
The measurement points are placed along a circle with the radius based on the wind turbines
dimensions. This is seen in figure 12, which is obtained from the standard [2].
The directivity is determined by measuring the A-weighted sound pressure level and the wind speed
simultaneously and then correcting the value for background noise and difference in distance
between measurement point and the hub of the rotor. These measurements are then compared with
the measurements from the reference measurement point (M1 in Fig.13).
4.3.1 Measurement points
The horizontal distance between measurement point and tower of the wind turbine is recommended
to be equal to the hub height plus the radius of the rotor with a tolerance of 20 %.
The inclination angle φ between measurement point and hub shall be between 25°-40°. (Fig.14)
The direction of the downwind measurement point should be within ±15° of the wind direction. [2]
Two additional measurement points were included for this measurement, M5 and M6 in fig.13.

Field study

The distance between measurement point and wind turbine hub varies due to the slant of the
farmland. Furthermore, the distance to reference point is equal to the distance from the ground to
the hub plus the radius of the rotor. The other measurement points are closer to the wind turbine.
The difference in distance is acceptable according to standard [2] and is corrected for in the results.
The slant distance is described in figure 14 which is from the standard [2].

4.3.2 Measurement interval and conditions
The measurements of sound pressure level were conducted for wind speeds 6-10 m/s, and the sound
pressure level was clustered into integer values of the wind speed.
At least 30 series of measurements with one minute per measurement was required, of these at
least three of the measurements shall be within ± 0.5 m / s of each integer of the wind speed. [2]
The background level is measured using the same method as the sound pressure level measurements
but with the wind turbine parked. These conditions were satisfied during the measurement.
4.3.3 Frequency range of the different measurements
All measurements were performed with a frequency range of 20-20000 Hz.
The frequency range required for the sound pressure level measurements, both narrowband and
octave bands are 50 Hz - 10 kHz according to standard. [2]
Frequency resolution for narrow-band analysis is 2-5 Hz in 2000 Hz and 2-12.5 Hz above 2000 Hz.
Octave -band analysis shall be calculated as the average of the energy level of at least three spectra
measured over a minute for each integer wind speed. [2]
4.3.6 Tonality
Tonality is the presence of tones in noise at various wind speeds. The tonality is determined by a
narrow band analysis with critical bands according to standard. [2]
This analysis has not been conducted however the term will be used as tones were existent.

Field study
4.3.7 Wind speed
Wind speed is measured using two methods. Method 1 calculated from the electrical power output
of wind turbine which is directly dependent on wind speed. Method 1 also requires an anemometer
at a reference height of 10 m to calculate the background noise. Method 2 is measured with an
anemometer height between the base and hub height, and then corrected with respect to the
reference height. It is also possible to measure only the hub height and then calculate the wind
speed at reference height [2]. The power curve is not from the object studied it is an example of how
a power curve for a wind turbine may look like, it is seen in fig. 15.

Fig.15. An example of how a power curve may look. It shows the output effect from a wind turbine.
4.3.7.1 Nacelle method
To determine wind speed between 5 % and 95% of rated power, the wind speed measured at the
nacelle Vn and the corrected wind speed VH at hug height which is determined from electrical power
output is combined in a linear regression. For wind turbines with active power control VH is corrected
for the current air density which is determined from:

output effect of the wind turbine, a linear regression has to be used.

The wind speed at nacelle height has been scaled to the wind speed at 10 m height assuming

4.3.7.2 К-factor method
Another method, which is not assuming a wind speed gradient, is the K-factor method.
It is used for an output effect less than 95% of the wind turbines max output effect.
(13)
Equation 13. The equation for the K-factor method
VZ in this method is the measured wind speed from the wind mast instead of the nacelle
anemometer. The nacelle anemometer method is preferred because the correlation between the
wind speed measured at the nacelle and the power curve effect output is better than for the wind
speed measured with the wind mast. [2]
However, for background measurements when there is no power curve the wind mast is required.
4.3.7.3 Determination of wind speed with an anemometer
For the field study, a wind mast was utilized in combination with the wind speed calculated from the
power curve. The wind speed was corrected to the reference height and reference roughness length
as described in eq. 12. During the background noise measurements, when the wind turbine is parked
the wind mast is appropriate for wind speed measurement. The allowable height of the anemometer
is seen in fig. 16 which is taken from the standard [2].

Analysis of the field study

5 Analysis of field study
5.1 Outline of analysis
The results have been analyzed according to the conditions from the standard [2]. To determine the
directivity, the background corrected noise level and the distance is needed. The background
corrected noise level should be an equivalent sound pressure level over a period of 1 minute.
The sound pressure level was measured and stored every second in third octave bands, while the
wind speed was stored every minute. Thus, the sound pressure levels were energy averaged into
equivalent levels over 1 minute in MS Excel® to be matched with the wind speed at that period of
time.
The values were corrected for the insertion loss of the primary wind screen in the sound level meter
and for secondary wind screens in MS Excel® (the calibration factors and method can be seen in
Appendix C). The sound pressure levels were A-weighted and then analyzed by frequency analysis,
regression analysis, statistical analysis and tonal analysis. These values could then be used to
determine the directivity. In this chapter the analysis needed to determine directivity and the
corrections that were conducted will be presented first, then the directivity will be presented in 5.5.
5.2 Frequency analysis
A frequency analysis is performed to determine how the sound pressure level is affected by the wind
speed and if there is strong sound sources that seems particular such as strong tones.
The analysis was performed in MS Excel® and presented in third octave band.
Due to the high wind speed during the measurement, there was disturbance from wind noise at the
microphone which can be seen at the low frequency third octave bands.
It is difficult to extract the high frequency wind induced noise from the noise from the wind turbine
when investigating sound pressure levels. Fig. 17 shows a frequency analysis of the reference point.

Analysis of the field study
5.3 Statistic analysis
To determine if the results are normally distributed a statistical analysis is performed to determine if
there are any abnormalities in the measurement.
A simple method to investigate this is to perform a graphical test for normal distribution.
This is performed by calculating the sound pressure level corresponding to a certain percentage of
the overall sound level, this is presented as a line representing a threshold through a third octave
band. This line is called for example LA90 which is the noise level exceeded for 90 % of the time
considered. LA30 are the lower dotted lines and LA10 the upper dashed lines seen in fig.18 and fig. 19.

Fig. 18. LA30 and LA10 for third octave band levels at 8 m/s wind speed

Fig. 19. LA30 and LA10 for third octave band levels at 8, 9 and 10 m/s wind speed (zoomed in on fig.18)
The spectrum analysis shows that there are tones at 125, 250, 630 and 2.5 kHz.
The tones at 125, 250 and 2.5 kHz origins from mechanical noise, 630 Hz may be gearbox-noise.

Analysis of the field study

5.4 Regression analysis
5.4.1 Summary of the regression analysis
According IEC 61400-11 [2] wind turbine noise is determined using the equivalent A-weighted sound
pressure level. To analyze the data a 4th order regression analysis should be applied to get the
apparent sound pressure level. A similar regression analysis should also be made for the background
noise. If the correlation is greater than 0.8 the 4th order analysis should be used, if it is less a linear
regression should be made dependent of the wind speed and divided into integer bins from it.

Fig. 20. Regression analysis of sound pressure level at reference measurement point
Fig.20 shows the regression analysis of the measurement point positioned crosswind in the reference
point. The characteristics of the regression curve shows that the sound pressure level peaks at 7,5
m/s and at higher wind speeds the noise level decreases until it reaches 9,5 m/s where it increases
once more. Similar characteristics could be observed at all measurement points and the regression
curves can be seen in Appendix A. The background noise increases with increasing wind speed.
Due to the low coefficient of determination (R2=0.1145), a bin analysis were performed for each
integer value of the wind speed between 6 and 10 m/s, which is according to standard.
This is performed by separating the total noise and backgrounds noise to wind speed bins for 6, 7, 8,
9 and 10 m/s and analyzing with linear regression.

The bin analysis shows similar results as the regression curve for the reference point.
However, for other measurement points a 4th order regression did not give a satisfying
approximation for sound pressure levels at wind speeds between 6-7 m/s.
Thus a bin analysis with linear regression for each wind speed was done for each measurement point
and the data for the presentation of directivity is based upon that analysis.
The sound power level for a wind speed of 8 m/s at 10 m height:
Bin analysis with linear regression: 101,9 dBA.
Regression analysis of 4th order: 101,9 dBA
The 4th order regression analysis with corresponding sound power level is seen in figure 21.

5.4.2 Corrections conducted in the regression analysis
The sound level meters at position M1, M2 and M6 (see fig.13) recorded sound for the possibility to
locate abnormal sounds such as vehicles or animals.
By listening to the different recordings a constant bird tweet was detected, the birds were close to
measurement positions M2 and M6 and by comparing the background noise recordings when the
birds were active and inactive it could be concluded that the third octave bands 5.3 kHz and 6.0 kHz
were affected by the tweet. An average of the all the measured sound levels between the affected
measurement points M2, M6 and M5 relative to M1 was performed and a correction were made for
all sound levels in the affected third octave bands.

5.5 Directivity of the sound
5.5.1 Description of the analysis of directivity
The sound pressure levels corrected for background noise retrieved from the bin analysis have been
adjusted by the difference in distance for each measurement point according to equation 3.
The comparison between the corrected values then constitutes a pattern for the horizontal
directivity of the total noise emitted from the wind turbine.
The directivity will be presented either as a polar plot with a circle representing the line on which the
measurement points have been placed around the wind turbine seen in Fig. 6a.
The circle will also be presented along a straight axis as in fig.22 with two ‘dips’ corresponding to the
crosswind direction or as a directivity index, which is the sound pressure levels in the measurement
points relative to the sound pressure level in the reference point Fig. 23.
For the sake of presentation, some data from points have been used on the opposite side of the wind
turbine to interpret the whole sound radiation pattern. This would be true if symmetry around the
wind turbine could be assumed. This is not the case, the true sound radiation pattern is only at the
measurement points, and the lines between two measurement points are only interpolation.
(M1=0°, M5=30°, M2=60°, M6=90°, M3=180°, M1=300°)
An example of a ‘mirrored’ measurement point is M6=90° which also is used as M6=270°

Fig. 22. Wind turbine noise prediction of the horizontal plane presented as a point diagram
In figure 22 a wind turbine noise prediction code from [5] has been used, it is apparent that there is a
5 dB difference between the two dips. The reason is shown in fig.1 where an acoustic camera shows
how the sound radiated towards the ground is louder when the rotor is revolving downwards in
comparison as to when it is revolving upwards.
This has not been implemented in the simulation used in this report. However, as the data used at
270° is the same data as for the measurement point at 90° it is redundant.

Analysis of the field study
5.5.2 Directivity Index
According to the standard [2] a method of showing the directivity of a sound source is the directivity
index. In fig.23 the directivity is shown according to equation 3 in chapter 2.1.4 Directivity of sound.
The curves are based on the sound pressure levels corrected for background noise for all the
measurement points. For a orientation on where the measurement positions are see fig.13.
Additionally an assumption of the sound pressure level at 270° being the same as at 90 have been
made. This is not essentially true because symmetry cannot be assumed. However, it gives a better
insight of the overall directivity around the wind turbine as mentioned in 5.5.1.

Fig. 23. The sound pressure level around the wind turbine relative to the reference point
In figure 23 the directivity in the far field for a wind turbine is shown. It shows how the sound
pressure level is different depending on the position of the observer and the wind speed.
The angle 0° corresponds to the position downwind of the wind turbine which is reference point M1
The angle 90° corresponds to the position in crosswind of the wind turbine, perpendicular to the
wind direction (M6)
The angle 180° corresponds to the position which is upwind of the wind turbine (M3).
The measurement points at 30° (M5), 60° (M2) and 300° (M4) is also included in fig.24
Notice that the curves are over determined due to interpolation for example at 301°-360° for 6 m/s

Analysis of the field study
5.5.3 Directivity at frequency range of aerodynamic sound sources
It is determined that the aerodynamic sound sources from the blades are the dominating source of
sound from modern wind turbines [19]. The directivity investigated in the simulation is aerodynamic
sources which gives reason to investigate the frequency range where aerodynamic sound is
apparent. This is conducted by summing the A-weighted sound pressure levels between 250 and 800
Hz which is the frequency range dominated by turbulent boundary layer noise.
There is a tendency for the measured values similar to the predicted but the difference in magnitude
in the crosswind position between the measured and predicted values is distinct.
In figure 7, where the predicted values are modified in the crosswind position to match a realistic
case the magnitude at 90° and 270° is –6 dB relative to the reference point. According to the
simulation used in this study, it is -14 dB relative to the reference point. In reality, according to the
field study it is -3.5 dB relative to the reference point. The measured values are plotted as a function
of the direction of the wind turbine and have been averaged when the angle is the same, thus the
spread of the clusters seen in figure 24. In Figure 25 the directivity index is shown.

Analysis of the field study
5.5.4 Directivity shown as polar plot
This chapter contains polar plots of the directivity with a comparison between prediction and
measurement. It is seen in figure 26 that the measure sound levels between 250 and 800 Hz, where
blade tip noise at 1 kHz is excluded, which is the frequency range of the trailing edge noise does not
follow the predicted sound levels of trailing edge noise. There is a decrease in the measured values
but due to background noise and other sources in the same frequency range the attenuation is not
close to the predicted. The sound pressure level as a function of nacelle direction seen in fig. 24 is
used as a polar plot in fig. 27. For orientation see Fig.13 in chapter 4.3.1.

Analysis of the field study

Fig. 28. Directivity shown as a polar plot sound pressure levels relative to reference point
In figure 28 the sound pressure level corrected for background noise is shown for the frequency
range 20 – 20000 Hz. The upwind measurement point has relatively low sound pressure levels and
thus a symmetric view of the measurement points does not show a representative picture of the
directivity. The upwind sound pressure levels are shown in dashed lines as it is unknown except for
the measurement point at 180°. Even though the plot in figure 26 only shows the sound levels in the
frequency range 250-800 Hz, similar results is seen for the whole frequency range as the attenuation
in the crosswind direction is around 3 to 4 dBA relative to the reference point. However in the
upwind direction the sound pressure levels are relatively high in comparison to the sound levels for
the measured frequency range 20-20000 Hz.

5.5 Uncertainty
The uncertainty of the measurements have been evaluated according to standard [2] for each
regression analysis. The method that have been implemented is shown in appendix B which explains
what factors are considered for the uncertainty and an example of values from the measurement in
reference position. The combined standard uncertainty is the individual standard measurement
uncertainties associated with the input quantities and have to be considered when evaluating the
results. The combined uncertainty for the regression analysis conducted for the reference point is
±0,78 dBA. The value depends on site condition and is an acceptable value according to the author.

5.6 Method evaluation
In the field study, all sound sources are included while in the prediction, only trailing edge noise is
accounted for. For a correct comparison, an integration contour that would separate the trailing
edge noise from other noises would be preferred instead of summing the A-weighted sound levels
between 250-800 Hz together. The reduction of the third octave band levels due to bird noise may be
incorrect and a band-stop filter would have been preferred. Symmetry around the wind turbine
cannot be assumed, the duplicated measurement points around the wind turbine may give an
incorrect view of the directivity pattern. More measurement points to achieve higher resolution are
recommended to determine directivity. However, the method is sufficient according to the author.

Discussion

6 Discussion
6.1 Concept of the study
The aim of this study was to investigate how the directivity of the sound sources from a wind turbine
influenced the sound radiation and how this could be applied to optimize the power output while still
fulfilling the conditions of noise at nearby building from different guidelines.
The turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise was the sound source that was mainly focused on in
this study due to it being the dominant sound source on modern wind turbines and because the
aerodynamic sound is more likely to have a strong directivity compared to mechanical noise.
The method used to investigate the directivity was based on a literature study and a following field
study. From the literature study it is apparent that the international standard [2] which includes a
method to investigate directivity from wind turbines has been tested with modifications in several
studies. Furthermore, several wind turbine noise predictions have been created based on the
simulation from Airfoil self noise and prediction [18]. Both field studies and simulations of the
directivity from different reports come to the same conclusion mentioned in 7.2.

6.2 Results of the literature study
There is a decrease of sound level in the crosswind direction of the wind turbine due to the dipole
character of the aerodynamic noise, especially due to the directivity of the trailing edge noise which
is the dominant sound source. Furthermore, due to refraction more than the directivity of the source
there tends to be lower sound levels upwind of the wind turbine in areas of ‘sound shadow’.

6.3 Results of the field study
The method used for the field study included emission measurements according to the setup for
directivity measurement from the standard [2] with a modification of adding two measurement
points to increase resolution in a quarter of a circle. The measurement positions covered important
directions from the wind turbine, however when investigating the full sound radiation pattern the
resolution was relatively low and a separation of 15° between each measurement point would have
been preferred. The results from the field study did not comply with the predicted sound pressure
levels. This was due to the fact that the prediction code only covered the dominant aerodynamic
sound source, the trailing edge noise. The trailing edge noise which has a dipole characteristic of
directivity and thus decreased rapidly in the crosswind direction due to the directivity function for
trailing edge noise (eq. 5) could not be directly compared to a measurement of the total noise as
other sources, both from the wind turbine and background noises becomes dominant in the area
where the trailing edge noise is decreased.
From the field study it is shown that the sound pressure level corrected for background noise in the
crosswind direction is approximately 3-4 dBA less than the sound pressure level corrected for
background noise at the reference point. According to prediction, it should be approximately 15 dB
less. This is not realistic however. To compare the prediction with measured values an integration
contour to separate the trailing edge noise from the measured values would have been required.
The relatively low sound pressure level in the upwind direction is most likely due to refraction.
It would have been optimal to measure wind speed at ground at each measurement point, however
it was measured according to standard with a wind mast upwind of the wind turbine.
Due to high wind speeds it is questionable if the wind screens managed to protect the microphone.
The total noise level over the whole frequency range is however directional from the wind turbine,
but the difference in sound pressure levels around the wind turbine are considered small.

31

Discussion

6.4 Reflections about the analysis
The concept of the analysis was to analyze each measurement point according to standard [2].
This was conducted by relating the sound pressure levels of the total noise when the wind turbine
was active to the wind speed at the moment of recording and then correcting the sound pressure
levels of the total noise by the background noise at the related wind speeds.
To achieve the correct values at certain wind speeds, a 4th order regression analysis for each
measurement point were performed, and if the coefficient of determination was relatively low (less
than 0.8 according to standard [2]) a bin analysis with linear regression for each value integer of the
wind speed was performed instead. This is the standardised method for emission measurements of
wind turbines conducted at present day and is an established method for sound level measurements
of wind turbines in Europe. The presentation of directivity according to the standard [2] is the
directivity index. The other methods of presenting directivity, such as assuming symmetry to give a
better view of the whole pattern around the wind turbine, are created by the author and should be
considered critically. For example, it is claimed that practically all downward radiated blade noise is
produced on the blades downward movement [10, 19] still an assumption of symmetry in the
crosswind direction have been made to give perspective of the directivity around the wind turbine.
The correction for bird tweet is a quick solution to a complex problem and should be considered
critically. Directivity is frequency dependent and should be investigated more thoroughly.
The wind speed was higher during the background measurement compared to the total noise
measurement, this causes the shift between the total noise data points and background data points
in the regression analysis and for lower wind speeds (6-7 m/s) the regression trend have to be
trusted. However, this increases the uncertainty as it is an assumption of the characteristic of wider
span of wind speed than was actually measured.

6.5 Query method
The query method used for the literature study was focused on directivity of sound from wind
turbines and the databases used are from the database collection at the library of the Royal institute
of technology. The reports used in the literature study and the information from them used in this
paper are considered reliable according to the author of the present paper.

6.6 Influence of the uncertainty
The measurement period were one hour with the wind turbine active and half an hour with the wind
turbine parked. The period satisfactory according to standard, however it only covers a limited range
of wind speeds. Thus it is uncertain how representative the background noise and total noise actually
are for regular noise levels at those wind speeds. This could perhaps be doubtful because the results
from the analysis are restricted to daytime.
The direction of the wind turbine was evaluated to be in the range of an angle ±15° relative to the
reference point, this was however uncertain and was measured by the eye. The other measurement
points were related to the reference point with distance meter.
There are several factors of uncertainty which have been approximated and the combined factors
have to be considered when evaluating the results. These factors are for example the standard error
of equivalent sound pressure levels, calibration, instrumentation such as ground board, instrument
chain, distance measurements, acoustic attenuation of air, meteorological variations, wind speed,
wind direction and background. The calculation of the uncertainty can be seen in Appendix B.

Conclusion

6.6 Sources of error
Apart from the sources of error mentioned in the influence of the uncertainty it should be noted that
the method for correction of bird noise is a matter of concern. The soil under the ground board was
flattened out to avoid acoustic resonators due to cavities between ground and board, this was
conducted quickly and small cavities may have influenced the measurement. The influence of the
secondary wind screens at the relatively high wind speed at ground due to the flat land of the region
is uncertain and the limit of the protection against wind induced noise at the microphone is not
known. However, the wind screens were made according to standard and similar wind screens are
approved fully in [15]. The results seem overall relatively reliable compared to what was expected
before the field study according to the author.

7 Conclusion
This study have been conducted to investigate the directivity of sound from wind turbines in order to
determined if it can be used to optimize the wind turbines output effect while still fulfilling the
guidelines of the sound pressure levels outside of nearby buildings.
In this study that is presented in this report the conclusions that could be made were:
 There is an apparent directivity for the total noise of a wind turbine where there is lower
sound levels in the crosswind direction compared to other points around the wind turbine
with equal distance from the source.
 The horizontal directivity pattern is of a dipole character due to the fact that the emitted
sound from the dominant sound source is decreased in the crosswind direction.
The aerodynamic sources which are also of a dipole character along the blade’s foil in the
vertical plane constitute the directivity in the vertical plane as well as the horizontal.
 The decrease of noise in the crosswind direction is not as prominent as suggested by the
theoretical prediction of the dominant sound source, due to the fact that other sound
sources contribute to the emitted sound in the crosswind direction and that the background
noise influences the measurement in the field study.
For a correct comparison an integration contour of the aerodynamic sound source is required
to separate the dominant sound source from the total noise at the location of the field study.
 The knowledge of the decrease of total noise in the crosswind direction could be used to
optimize the output effect of the wind turbine. If the wind turbine is limited due to the sound
it emits it could be regulated with the pitch angle of the blade when the crosswind direction
is facing nearby buildings to optimize the output effect. The difference in total noise is
relatively small and one have to consider the fact that the sound emitted may be louder at
lower wind speeds than the wind speed where the wind turbine has optimized output effect.
There is a horizontal directivity that can be observed from the measurements conducted in the field
study. For the total noise, the sound pressure level measured at the point in the crosswind direction
is 2-3 dBA less than the sound pressure level in the reference point depending on wind speed.
For the frequency range of the trailing edge noise the difference is 3-4 dBA varying on wind speed.
Combined with the other measurement points, the dipole character of the horizontal directivity is
shown and by comparing the measurement to the noise prediction the dipole character trend is not
verified but it appears that with modification the prediction could demonstrate the directivity. The
difference of sound levels is relatively low. The application of directivity to optimize output effect
could be utilized, but the advantage has to be quantified before a conclusion can be made.

Decreasing noise from wind turbines
The newly built wind turbines are getting larger in both hub height and rotor diameter, due to this
the problem of aerodynamic noise from the wind turbines will only increase if the blade design is not
adjusted to decrease the noise. Thus the directivity of the aerodynamic sound might become more
important in the future.
The blades are designed aerodynamically to optimize the output effect. However, some research has
been conducted to investigate the character of the aerodynamic sound sources for jagged edges on
the suction side of the blade. Such design may be of interest to decrease the trailing edge noise even
though the aerodynamic properties of the blade may be decreased at the cost.
Modern wind turbines can be regulated to reduce the aerodynamic sound, this is done by adjusting
the pitch angle of the blades. Another option is to reduce the number of revolutions or limit the time
when the wind turbine is active. These options may be required at evenings and nights when the
background noise is lower and nearby residents may be disturbed by the wind turbine noise.
Other solutions, such as a quieter design of the blades or regulation of the wind turbine adjustment
due to the sound radiation pattern may be preferred to sustain the wind turbine active as much as
possible. By a more thorough study of the predicted and measured directivity of a wind turbine a
standardised system to regulate the noise from wind turbines could be utilized to both optimize the
power output and preserve a low noise level. These are both important factors for the expansion of
wind energy in the energy market.
Improvements of the field study
A field study with a denser measurement point setup around the wind turbine to increase the
resolution of the directivity pattern together with imission measurement at a nearby building should
be performed to estimate if the wind turbine could be optimized in output effect due to directivity.
To decrease the uncertainty, the measurement should be conducted during a longer period, covering
more wind speeds and also a longer period during the night to investigate how the noise varies
dependent on temperature inversion.
This study is limited to the horizontal directivity. A field study of vertical directivity is a complex
measurement where either measurement points at hub height or several measurement points on a
row with different distance from the wind turbine is required. Assuming that horizontal directivity is
the complete sound radiation pattern of a wind turbine is a simplification as the sound may
propagate different at an altitude of hub height than it does at ground. Horizontal directivity
considers observers on a close distance. It is however possible that the sound propagates further on
a higher altitude and that the directivity pattern on longer distance is different.
Improvements of the wind turbine noise prediction
A more specific wind turbine noise prediction should be created. It should include the exact
dimensions of the segments of the blade that are considered and the sound sources are associated
with the segment where the source actually origin. A more accurate function that supersedes the
extreme decrease of sound pressure level in the crosswind direction is required such as the
prediction by Moriarty [20] or Oerlemans [19]. Furthermore, all sound sources from the wind turbine
should be included if it should be compared to the total noise of a wind turbine.

Appendix C Calibration of Wind screens
The calibration of secondary wind screens was according to a method described in [15].
This measurement of the insertion loss is conducted by simulating the inclination angle with an omnidirectional loudspeaker on a stand with the height that simulates the ratio of ±20 % of the reference
length (R0) from the wind turbine. The measurements are conducted with pink noise from the
loudspeaker which is then corrected for background noise by a measurement of background noise
immediately after. The three cases that are used are based on the primary wind screen, a 90 mm
foam wind screen in two different versions (a whole sphere and half a sphere) and finally a case
without primary wind screen. The calibration for the last case is used as the sound level meters have
an internal correction for the primary wind screen. Each case are repeated three times with
background measurements in between and then averaged. The difference seen in fig.30 (excl. little
ball) is used to calibrate the measurement data for the influence of the secondary wind screen.
