Abstract

The ACM 2 spot weld model is the currently most widely used spot weld model in industry. It
is designed to be tuned using parameters to represent the stiffness characteristics of a spot
weld in a suitable way. The choice of these parameters is however often associated with
uncertainties. Therefore, the set of parameters with best performance is determined by
employing an updating algorithm. Further, the result is compared to a new category of
models, the so called Spider models, which intend to overcome mesh dependence in the
spot weld area by re-meshing the structures locally. The results are formulated as guidelines
for the optimum implementation of these spot weld models for structural dynamics. The
studies are performed using two cut-out parts from a Volvo FH truck cabin.
In addition, a new analytical approach for updating material data of isotropic shell structures
is derived and the equations are verified using the same test pieces.

1 Introduction

1.1 Context
Ever increasing material, energy and salary costs in a modern globalized world stress the
importance of improving and optimizing product design in the automotive industry.
Computational tools are required for this optimization process [1].
The finite element method is a versatile computation technique that can be applied to various
problems in engineering applications in order to understand and enhance product behavior
under various loads and boundary conditions. Using the finite element method, powerful
computers make it nowadays possible to analyze the vibrations of large structures such as
whole body-in-whites more than one million degrees of freedom [2].
Aiming at decreasing the product time to market, this capability can be used to manually or
even automatically improve product designs by computational algorithms. As prediction
errors can be costly if detected at a late development stage, this requires accurate and
reliable prediction methods and implies the necessity of minimizing model errors.
Within finite element modeling, the area of noise and vibrations has become increasingly
important during the last decades as low levels of for example car and truck cabin noise and
vibrations contribute to the definition of the high quality and comfort of a product. Moreover,
models that are capable of determining the vibrational behavior of a mechanical structure
can be used to analyze durability, which often is an important design criterion.
In the course of this thesis, currently available computer models for structural dynamics are
evaluated and further developed considering the example of spot welds in vehicle structures.

1.2 Spot welds in vehicle structures
In mass production of automotive structures, spot welds are used extensively to join thin
metal sheets and beams; a car or truck body-in-white commonly contains several thousand
spot welds. In a fully automated process, spot welds are formed when two sheet metals are
pressed together by two electrodes and an electric current locally heats up the material such
that the connection is established [3]. Thus, no material is added during the welding process.
Spot weld electrodes typically have a diameter of about four to seven millimeters while the
diameter of the actual connection between the sheets can differ from that value, as can be
seen in Figure 1 where a cut through a spot weld is displayed. This figure also shows that
both the geometry of the sheets and the material properties are changed locally during the

welding process. The electrodes can leave a surface print making the local geometry
complex. In addition, the temperature change during welding carries along a hardening of the
metal as the Vickers hardness almost doubles in the center of the spot weld. Therefore, the
material properties subdivide the spot weld into three different zones, a base material zone
(BM), a heat affected zone (HAZ) as well as the area of the spot weld nugget (SW). Residual
stresses and defects due to the welding process can complicate the characteristics of the
connection even further.

1.3 Modeling spot welds in automotive finite element analysis
for structural dynamics
Modeling such a complex connection for a finite element analysis is demanding. For
automotive structures, such as a whole body-in-white, the accuracy of calculated modes at
frequencies above 80Hz is limited by model errors such as structural joints and metal sheet
thickness variations [1]. As spot welds are by far the most common connector in a body-inwhite, it can be assumed that errors in modeling spot welds are significant. Moreover, major
sources of error within the spot weld models are false assumptions for parameters
characterizing and influencing the characteristics of the models [2].
In order to model spot welds accurately, many models have been developed aiming at
different applications such as durability, structural dynamics, stress analysis and crash
simulation. Each of these areas has different requirements on the models, for example a
model for stress analysis requires a sufficient number of elements to be able to predict the
stress distribution and result in sufficiently smooth stress curves.
Considering structural dynamics analysis, it is possible to define two basic requirements that
a suitable model should be able to fulfill. These requirements are (1) the model is as
accurate as possible within the important characteristics for structural dynamics and (2) it is
practical to use, i.e. automating connector implementation is feasible [5].

3

1 Introduction

Unfortunately, these two requirements aim at different directions. On the one hand, the
above mentioned high complexity of spot welds makes it necessary to use a large number of
finite elements to resolve all local effects. On the other hand,
hand the high numb

and implementation effort.. Therefore, the first models thatt were introduced about twenty
years ago were indeed very simple.
simple. They used, for example,
example one single bar connecting one
node of each part, accepting larger modeling errors but facilitating implementation [2]. This
conflict between a high number of degrees of freedom in the model and accurac
accuracy
y has to be
balanced by all models.
A possibility to overcome this problem is to use models that feature parameters allowing for
tuning them to their real characteristics. In addition, compared

to stress analysis, structural
dynamics has the advantage that the spot weld models
model only need to represent the stiffness
of the joints
joint in a correct way while internal stresses are not important.
One of the models that fulfills these requirements is shown in Figure 2.. The metal plates are
commonly modeled with coarse meshes with approximately 10mm shell edge length and the
spot weld nugget is here modeled with eight solid bricks. Moreover, its characteristics can be
tuned by parameters
parameters such as nugget Young’s modulus and nugget diameter.

1.4 Earlier investigations
During the past twenty years, many spot weld models have been developed and extensive
research has been done with the aim of finding an easy to implement and yet accurate
model. As a consequence, about 30 connector models are available in Ansa, a preprocessor
that is widely used in industry for structural modeling and that is currently also used at Volvo
3P. Some of these models have been reviewed and compared in literature, most importantly
by Palmonella et al. [2, 6 and 7]] in 2003 to 2005. Despite of this effort, a model that fulfills all
requirements in a perfect way has not been found yet. In addition, new tools in preprocessors

4

1 Introduction

make it nowadays possible to re-mesh the finite element meshes locally in the area of the
spot weld automatically, which led to the development of a new category of models that are
known as the Spider models. One of the objectives of this thesis is therefore to review and
evaluate these new models.

1.5 Previous analyses at Volvo 3P
At Volvo 3P, two investigations with regard to spot weld models were carried out in 2007 [8]
and 2011 [9]. The former analyzed a cut-out of the rear wall of an FH truck cabin and
included a parameter study for the currently used spot weld model. The latter was part of the
European MID-MOD project [10] where an FH cab floor was measured and calculations
including seven different spot weld models were analyzed and compared.
However, the results of both of these investigations did not provide clear recommendations
for future models. Among the most accurate models was a model similar to the layout shown
in Figure 2, called the Spider 2 model, but using different elements for the core of the nugget.
The investigations concluded that other errors and uncertainties in the models of the whole
structure were larger than the ones introduced by errors of the spot weld models. Therefore,
it was recommended that “one should have full control of the physical geometry, material
properties for different steel grades and also include stamping information in the model” in
future investigations [9]. By the latter, it is referred to the effect that during stamping of cab
panels and structural members, the sheet metal thickness decreases due to stretching of the
material. In the same study, the desire of using a model that is more controlled by direct and
natural parameters such as diameter and depending less on abstract values and the mesh in
the vicinity of the spot weld was expressed [9].
At Volvo 3P, a model that is in literature known as the ACM 2 model is currently used for
structural modeling. This model is designed to be tuned using parameters. Yet, the current
choice of these parameters is associated with uncertainties. The parameter for the diameter
of the spot weld nugget was for example determined to fit results from fatigue calculations
[8]. Apart from this choice and the above mentioned parameter study (see [8]), no efforts
have been done to optimize the models with regard to their parameters.

1.6 Objectives and structure of the thesis
This thesis aims at evaluating and improving the currently available computer models for
structural dynamics in order to contribute to future high quality designs of automotive
structures. Three questions are addressed in the course of this research:
1.

As described above, new tools in preprocessors allow for re-meshing the finite element
meshes locally in the area of the spot weld automatically which led to the development
of a new category of models that are known as the Spider models. The first objective of
this thesis is to review and evaluate these new models since literature is lacking such an
evaluation so far.

In addition to the comparison of different spot weld models, individual models are
optimized in order to represent the characteristics of a real spot weld in the best possible
way. This is done by comparing calculation results with measurements and applying
optimization algorithms that automatically calculate optimum sets of parameters. These
algorithms can also be applied for the optimization of other connectors such as glue or
sealings. They can further shed light on the influence of paint in the course of research
projects or assist in finding better product designs.
Finally, the question of whether a model can be used that is less dependent on abstract
parameters and that is more controlled by natural parameters such as diameter and
sheet thickness and that can be derived from the geometry can be found is addressed.

The layout of this thesis starts with a literature review on different spot weld models. Chapter
3 describes relevant theory with regard to updating FEM models, calculations and
comparison methods. Chapter 4 gives an overview on the criteria for the selection of
benchmark structures from an FH truck cabin. The results of measurements and calculations
are presented in Chapters 5 and 6. Finally, guidelines for modeling spot welds are presented,
methods are discussed and conclusions from the study are drawn (Chapter 7).

2 Spot weld models in literature

2 Spot weld models in literature

Many different kinds of spot weld models have been developed for different fields of analysis.
With regard to structural analysis, the preprocessor Ansa provides about 30 different spot
weld models that are suitable for vibration calculations. Because of this large number of
models, an overview on the different models is given in this chapter and the basic
approaches of the most common ones are described.

2.1 Types of spot welds
In general, two main types of spot welds exist, those that allow calculating the stress within
the spot weld and those that do not [7]. The first case requires very detailed models with
numerous elements in order to be able to calculate a smooth stress field within and in the
surrounding of the spot weld.
In the latter case, where only a correct representation of the mass- and stiffness distribution
is necessary, simple models with few elements can be applied. However, these elements are
often dependent on parameters and only result in correct characteristics if the parameters
are chosen in a correct way.
Many of the following spot welds were described by Palmonella et al. [2, 6 and 7] between
2003 and 2005 and three of them were reviewed in detail in their studies. In addition, new
developments in preprocessors during the past years nowadays allow an automatic
implementation of more advanced models. These tools are able to re-mesh the geometry
locally in the surrounding of the spot weld such that the meshes on both metal sheets
coincide, i.e. that nodes on opposite geometries are facing each other. Before these
techniques were introduced around 2005, these models could only be realized by re-meshing
the whole sheets which was time consuming and often involved manual procedures [11].

2.2 Models for stress calculation
Models that are used for stress calculations commonly consist of a fine brick or plate element
mesh modeling the nugget. The high number of elements is necessary in order to produce
smooth stress fields that could, for example, be used for fatigue life estimation. A detailed
model representing this category was developed by Seeger et al. [4] and is shown in Figure
3. This model uses a detailed model to analyze the dynamic behavior of spot welds aiming at
the replacement of experimental testing in crash simulations. It takes into account the
changes of material properties described in the introduction and displayed in Figure 1. A
similar model is used by Deng et al. [12] to analyze stress fields in the spot welds.

simple ones.

2.3.1 Single bar or beam models
The first spot weld models consisted of
elastic models, rigid bar models, beam
models or coincident nodes that connect
one node on each plate and thus require a
congruent mesh [5].. The connection Figure 4

case the characteristics of the spot weld can be influenced by changing the Young’s modulus
or the diameter of the bar or beam. It was shown that this kind of spot weld model tends to
underestimate the stiffness [7] and does not represent the spot welds in an appropriate way.

2.3.2 Single brick models
Pal and Cronin [13] suggested to model spot welds with a single brick element connecting
two panels. Here, all eight corner points are connected to plate shell elements. Thus the
model requires congruent meshes. Again the Young’s modulus of the brick nugget and its
dimensions can be used to tune the characteristics of the model. In their analysis they
showed that this kind of model gives acceptable results [13].

2.3.3 Umbrella and ACM 1 model
The so-called Umbrella spot weld model
displayed in Figure 5 was developed for
the purpose of fatigue life analysis and
stiffness predictions and consists of 16
beams in each plate with one beam
joining the sheets while the sheets
themselves are modeled with shell
elements [14]. A modification of this model
that is known as Area Contact Model 1
(ACM1) in literature uses rigid bar
elements instead of beams and is
intended to be used for fatigue life
predictions [7].

Figure 5

Umbrella spot weld model [14].

2.3.4 Salvini and Vivio models
Salvini et al. and Vivio et al. [15-17] developed three different models for fatigue life
estimations that are all based on an analytical solution of a circular plate using the same
principal approach. Since fatigue failure commonly occurs outside the nugget, the models
consider the center to be rigid and the shell elements in the surrounding of the spot weld are
replaced by radial beams that are connected to the nodes of shell elements lying further
away. As can be seen in Figure 6, the stiffness of each of the radial beams is calculated by
evaluating analytical equations that describe an angular sector of the circular plate. Since the
beams in Figure 6 are all connected in one central point, the nugget itself is modeled through
a rigid offset inside the radial beams. The nugget connection between the two plates consists
of a central beam with six degrees of freedom per node.

The first of these models was reviewed by Palmonella [7] and showed good results for
structural dynamics analysis.

2.3.5 ACM 2 model
In 1999, Heiserer et al. [19] proposed a
new modeling approach that is today the
most widely used spot weld model for
structural vibrations in industry [6] and is
currently also used at Volvo 3P. This
model uses a solid element as nugget at
the position of the spot weld. Its node
points are not directly integrated in the
shell mesh but are interpolated on close
mesh points using RBE3 elements that
interpolate the loads on the nodes using
weight factors assigned to each node Figure 7

element does not have rotational degrees
of freedom, the moments acting on these degrees of freedom of the shell elements are
transferred as forces on the brick element [6]. The model is shown in Figure 7 where the
corner points of the solid are connected to shell mesh points with dashed lines which
represent the RBE3 interpolation element. The name Area Contact Model 2 (ACM 2) stems
from the characteristic that the connection is not realized through one single node point but
by several shell mesh points, which are called the patch area.

The creation of this element is fully automated and used for example in the preprocessing
software Ansa. The welded plates are allowed to be meshed independently and the spot
weld connection is implemented afterwards using the existing shell mesh points, thus no re-

meshing is required. This model has a number of different parameters that can be changed
in order to fit the characteristics:
•

Patch diameter

•

Area scale factor changing the area of the solid element as a fraction of the real spot
weld area

•

Solid Young’s modulus

•

Shear modulus of the solid

•

Solid density

•

Young’s modulus of the underlying shell elements in the patch area, both sides can
be adjusted separately requiring two parameters

•

Thickness of the shell elements in the patch area

•

Shear modulus of the patch shell elements

Not all of these parameters can be changed easily in preprocessing softwares, however. In
Ansa, only the first five of the above parameters can be implemented automatically by the
model. This model was already reviewed in Palmonella et al. [2, 6 and 7] and modeling
guidelines for some of the parameters were defined.

2.3.6 CWELD model
The CWELD model was proposed by
Fang et al. [11] in 2000 and follows a
similar idea as the ACM 2 model using a
patch including an interpolation method.
Thus, the meshes do not have to be
congruent. The nugget itself is modeled as
a special shear flexible beam with six
degrees of freedom per node. A schematic
of the model is shown in Figure 8. The
model was developed for MSC Nastran
with the aim of creating a general purpose
connector. It used to be one of the most
popular spot weld models as it can be

patches [11].

Since the model is included in Nastran’s element library, it is more difficult to change
parameters of the model. For example, in Ansa, the patch area cannot be changed which
only leaves three parameters:
•

Patch Young’s modulus

•

Area moment of inertia of the beam which is equal to changing the area of the spot
weld

model with an RBE2 spider nugget thus follows a similar idea
as the Umbrella model. As presented in Figure 9,, it is possible to create one or two shell
element zones around the spot weld nugget with varying number of circle elements

Similarly to the other models, the
the characteristics of these models can be tuned to fit the

2.4 Selecting spot weld models for this analysis
Given the large amount of available models, it is necessary to select a limited number of spot
weld models for consideration in this study. The selection of models considers the model’s
performance and practicability.

2.4.1 Physical characteristics of spot welds
Not all of the characteristics outlined in Chapter 1.2 have to be taken into account for the
application this thesis aims at. In the present context, mainly the stiffness characteristics of
the spot weld are important in order to calculate the modal behavior of the structure while
changes in hardness of the material are less significant as they only need to be taken into
account in crash simulations and durability analysis. Moreover, the elastic characteristics of
the material such as Young’s modulus do not change to the same extend since the Young’s
modulus of steel is in general close to the value of 210GPa. Therefore, the variation of
material data has not to be taken into account by models for structural dynamics.
Palmonella [2] found that spot welds with different physical diameters do not change the
dynamic characteristics of the structure significantly. Considering spot weld diameters of 5, 6
and 7mm which are used in his study, the area of the spot weld nugget almost doubles from
a 5 to 7mm spot weld resulting in a significantly stiffer nugget. Thus, it can be concluded that
the flexibility of the spot weld connection is greatly influenced by the surrounding area while
the nugget itself can almost be considered rigid.
Similarly, Deng [12] found in his numerical studies that stress, and thus deformation being
directly related to stress according to Hooke’s law, is often concentrated near the nugget
boundary, This suggests that a model that allows for a realistic modeling of the surrounding
might be favorable. Models focusing on modeling this effect are the Salvini and Vivio models
in which analytical descriptions of the plate are used to describe the spot weld stiffness. The
Spider models follow a similar idea accounting for good modeling of the neighboring zones
by using fine and good quality mesh.
The ACM 2 and CWELD models are abstract models that do not represent the flexibility of
the structure in a physical sense as stiffness is tuned by setting parameters of the nugget.
However, Kaltenböck et al. [18] describes that the size, distribution and quality of shell
elements in the patch area for these models have great influence on their stiffness as well.
They propose a Spider model to overcome this mesh dependence as it is possible to assure
constantly good mesh quality at the nugget boundary by reconstructing the mesh. Moreover,
through the finer mesh close to the spot weld, the flexibility of the plate can be modeled in a
more realistic way.

2 Spot weld models in literature

13

2.4.2 Divergence of point-to-point connections
Lardeur et al. [5] have shown that point-topoint spot weld models such as rigid bar,
flexible bar or beam connections diverge
with mesh refinement. This effect is
presented in Figure 10 where two of the
analyzed models converge and two
diverge for small shell mesh sizes.
According to this, punctual models are too
soft when very small shell elements are
used to model the structure. In contrast,
models that use several shell mesh points
to connect the plates result in constant
values for structural stiffness and
eigenfrequencies. This suggests to
exclude simple point-to-point models from Figure 10 Convergence and divergence of

dependence on mesh size is not desirable. Instead, models featuring an area contact should
be used.

2.4.3 Model selection
In order to preselect models for the following analysis, the above described physical and
numerical effects should be accounted for. With respect to the requirement of easy
implementation only models that are already implemented in Ansa are considered, leaving
out the Salvini and Vivio models. To allow for comparison with the model currently in use at
Volvo 3P and due to its popularity in industry, the ACM 2 model is included.
The most promising new model to be considered is the Spider 2 model. This model is
available in Ansa and seems to be able to model the stiffness of a real spot weld in a natural
way being less dependent on parameters than the other models, which was formulated as a
desire in the set-up of the study. Further, the Spider 2 model showed the best results in a
previous study at Volvo 3P [9].

3 Model updating

3 Model updating

This chapter covers basic theory in model updating which will be used to find optimum
parameters for spot weld models.

3.1 Updating methods
According to Friswell and Mottershead [1], there are in principal two different methods of
updating finite element models. The direct method updates mass and stiffness matrices
directly without using physical parameters. Other methods are reliant on physical parameters
in order to update the models. The first, direct approach has the disadvantage that no insight
– and thus no understanding – of the modeling errors is gained, thus this method is not
considered in this thesis.
Instead, methods using physical parameters, such as spot weld diameter or Young’s
modulus, are employed. By observing differences to the original model, findings can be
implemented in future models and other structures.
The updating procedure is commonly formulated as an optimization problem where an
objective function describing the quality of the models is minimized iteratively. This objective
function could, for example, use one of the comparison methods between the FEM model
and measurements that are described below.
The choice of physical parameters has significant importance for this kind of model updating.
For example, the parameters can adjust the shape of the mesh or account for local effects
that cannot be taken into account by the model. These effects can include local deformation
of the metal sheets in the spot weld area caused by the electrodes during welding. In
addition, changing the value of a parameter should influence the model characteristics, i.e.
the model should be sensitive to the parameter.
In order to update the models, different comparison methods of calculations and
measurements are conceivable, as described in the following section.

3.2 Evaluation methods
Aiming at comparing calculations and measurements, it becomes important to dispose of a
comparison method easy to use. It ideally describes the model quality compared to the
measurements in one variable and can be implemented in optimization algorithms. In
general, there are three different methods available.

15

3 Model updating

3.2.1 Frequencies
A simple and yet practicable approach is the comparison of calculated and measured
frequencies. A function such as equation (3-1) could be used to define the accuracy of the
model and to describe this in a single variable. In general, different parameters do not have
the same influence on all modes [2]. In order to find the right set of parameters, several
natural frequencies such as the first five or ten frequencies should be used.
(3-1)

*+, = ∑789: .

/0

123
/0

− 15

However, this approach is not sufficient for model verification alone as it has to be assured
that right frequencies in measurements and calculations are correlated. Especially for
frequency ranges with high modal density, modes can change their sequence which would
result in wrong correlation. In addition, it should be considered that the point of excitation or
response measurement can be a node of one of the modes and thus this particular mode
cannot be measured. In consequence, the above objective function can be used if it can be
assured that the corresponding frequencies are correlated.

3.2.2 Modal Assurance Criterion
The Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) allows a comparison of mode shapes of calculated
and measured modes using a single value for each pair of mode shapes. This criterion can
especially be used to prove correlation between different modes, i.e. if a measured frequency
is correlated to the correct calculated mode. It is defined as the normalized scalar product of
two mode shape vectors, a measured vector ;8 and a calculated vector ;< :
(3-2)

=>?8< = |@ |D@

BD

=>? matrix that has values approaching one for corresponding mode shapes and values

Applying this equation to all combinations of measured and calculated modes results in a
close to zero for non-matching modes. If measurement and calculations correspond ideally
the result is the unity matrix.

3.2.3 Frequency response functions
A third comparison method is a direct comparison of frequency response functions (FRF).
This approach can especially be used if a modal analysis of the experimental data is not
possible, for example for the middle frequency range or high modal density. One method of
comparing frequency response functions is called the frequency response assurance criteria
(FRAC) which is available at Volvo 3P as a Matlab script [9]. Here, the comparison can be
manipulated through a smear factor and a frequency shift factor. The smear factor intends to
improve correlation and the frequency shift factor shifts the FRFs on the frequency axis with
respect to each other in a certain range and takes the value with the highest correlation.

16

3 Model updating

However, one problem can be the use of an exponential window if impact excitation is used
during measurement as this window especially influences the damping of the measurement
result and thus the frequency response functions.

3.3 Nastran material updating algorithm
Nastran allows defining optimization
algorithms using an objective function that
can evaluate the results of any kind of
analysis and solve optimization problems
iteratively with the SOL200 function. The
updating method that is described in the
following is using this ability to solve an
objective function in the form of equation
(3-1) that is minimized to obtain the best fit
between
the
FE
model
and
measurements. Here, modal values such
as frequencies are directly calculated for
the set of parameters of each iteration
step and the objective function can be
evaluated using these values, which can
be seen in the principal structure of the
code shown in Figure 11.
Before starting the optimization, the modes
of measurements and calculations are
correlated using the MAC method. In order
to assure that the results remain correct
when modes change their order, mode
tracking is used in the algorithm. In
addition, the test pieces were chosen such
that the first ten modes are well separated.
In Chapter 2, it was outlined that, in
principal, there are two different types of
parameters of spot weld models, material
parameters and shape parameters. Figure 11 Simplified flow chart for the Nastran
SOL200 algorithm.

characteristics of the material in the spot weld area and shape parameters vary the mesh
and thus the geometry. In Nastran, it is comparatively easy to define an optimization for the
first of these types while the second one is connected with significant effort. Therefore, this
algorithm is limited to update material data and reduces the effort and number of calculations

17

3 Model updating

significantly. All three relevant material characteristics can be optimized – Young’s modulus,
Poisson’s ration and density. Therefore, the great advantage of this method is that it is exact
and gives the optimum result of these parameters with low effort; the disadvantage is that
parameters such as spot weld- or patch diameter have to be changed manually. Shape
optimization is not implemented due to its effort in implementation.
The code of the optimization in Nastran is shown in 0.

3.4 Deriving exact analytical equations for updating
If single parts consisting only of shell elements of the same Young’s modulus and density are
updated, there is no need for performing a finite element analysis. For this case, simple
analytical correlations can be derived. The equations will be used to verify the Nastran
algorithm when results of the analytical solution and the finite element method are compared.

3.4.1 Deriving a correlation to analytically update the Young’s
modulus of an isotropic shell structure with measurements

A shell structure consisting of an isotropic material with the Young’s modulus F is

with very low damping which is the case for the plates analyzed in this thesis.
For such a structure, the equation of motion for free vibrations becomes [21]

where G′ no longer is a function of the Young’s modulus. Inserting this correlation in the

equation of motion from above, it becomes

H−I6 = + F G′K; = 0.

Moreover, this equation is equal to

Finally, a new normalized frequency can be defined as
(3-7)

and thus the equation of motion results in

H−IN6 = + G′K; = 0.

From this equation, it can be observed, that both G′ and = are independent of the Young’s

modulus which indicates that the results of I′ always are the same – independent of the
Young’s modulus of the structure. Moreover, the mode shapes ; generally do not depend on

The Young’s modulus found with this equation has to be the minimum of the objective
function; from the quadratic character of the function it becomes clear that it only has one
extremum which has to be a minimum.
As can be seen, the Young’s modulus can be updated using experimental frequencies by
using one initial finite element analysis with known Young’s modulus. After that, the updated
Young’s modulus can easily be calculated using a pocket calculator, independently of the
size of the structure. If the spot welds in a whole body-in-white are modeled with multi point
constraints, such as RBE2 connections, the equation is even valid for a whole body-in-white
that is welded with spot welds if it does not feature significant amounts of glue. Thus, such a
structure can be updated and the exact results can be obtained in two minutes using a
pocket calculator instead of running a simulation lasting several hours.

Similarities of this equation to the updating of the Young’s modulus can be observed. With
this result, the density of a part with homogenous density for which an initial FE calculation is
available, can be updated exactly. This does not have such an importance for practical
problems as the density commonly can be measured dividing the mass of a part by its

volume and both entities can be measured easily. The advantage compared to updating the
Young’s modulus is that non-isotropic structures can be updated.

3.4.3 Deriving a correlation to analytically update the Young’s
modulus and density of an isotropic shell structure with
measurements
The previous example was most importantly shown because equations that are valid for both
variables are derived in the following. This will give an important insight in the possibilities of
updating material properties of homogenous and isotropic shell structures.
Now, both the normalized mass matrix M N and normalized stiffness matrix K′ are inserted in

the equation of motion (3-3) resulting in

Trying to solve these equations it turns out however, that they are linear dependent.
Therefore, the result of this system of equations is a line of an infinite number of extremum
points. As the approach is exact, it can therefore be concluded that updating the Young’s
modulus and density of an isotropic and homogenous plate at the same time does not result
in one single possible solution but in many possible solutions of which all are equal and
result in the same, optimum characteristics of the FE model. Therefore, it is sufficient to
include one of these parameters during updating with Nastran. Further it is concluded that
the change of Young’s modulus and density of a structure have the same influence on the
model’s characteristics.

4 Benchmark structures

The spot weld models should be verified using benchmark structures from a cut-out of an FH
truck cabin. This chapter describes requirements and criteria for the selection of a suitable
geometry as well as the characteristics of the selected models.

4.1 Requirements
A general guideline for selecting suitable geometries for testing was to reduce complexity
and uncertainty in all influences. To reduce complexity, the size of the structures should not
be too large but large enough to maintain the character of a real cabin part. A size of a
structure containing around 20 spot welds was considered optimal.
Previous analyses at Volvo 3P were conducted on test structures containing both glue and
sprayed damping material. It was found that these extra materials introduced an additional
uncertainty in the model [8]. Thus, the structures considered in this study are free of glue,
paint and damping material.
Further, a previous study concluded that thickness information from stamping is valuable in
models [9]. In order to include this information in the present investigation, geometries have
to be identified for which stamping simulation data is available.
In addition, up-to-date geometry information must be available for all parts and the geometry
is verified using geometry measurement data. The positions of the cuts and the spot welds
are implemented in the models using these geometry measurements.
Finally, the natural frequencies of the single parts are measured and compared with the FE
models. This procedure provides both valuable information on the reliability of the FE model
and the material data can be updated using the above Nastran optimization. The model
uncertainties are thus reduced further. In addition, the material data of the single parts is
updated before welding using the same Nastran optimization algorithm that is described
above for spot weld model updating.
With these precautions, it is supposed that good structural models can be obtained in which
the error due to the spot weld models is isolated and the difference between the two models
investigated becomes evident.

Frequency distribution for the two test structures. The modes are well separated and the
frequency ranges from about 60 to 400Hz.

Here, especially the frequency range of the first 10 modes is considered as a criterion.
Second, the modes have to be well-separated so that modal analyses can be performed with
the experimental data and that correlation between the calculated and the experimental data
is possible. A major limitation during the preliminary analyses is the availability of sheet
thinning information.
The resulting frequency distributions of the test structures are shown in Figure 14 while the
corresponding geometries are displayed in Figure 15.

4.3 Geometries
The two test pieces that resulted from the preliminary analysis fulfill all the major
requirements. They are presented in Figure 15.
The first structure consists of cut-outs of the parts with the library names Roof Panel and
Roof Member. As the assembly is a beam structure located just above the wind screen in the
top of the cabin, it is referred to as Topbeam in the following. The Roof Panel has a thickness
of 1.5mm and the Roof Member is 1.2mm thick. Both parts are stamped. The panels are
welded with 28 spot welds on the flanges. The length of the beam is about 858mm.
The second structure includes cut-outs of the Firewall, as well as Cross Member; therefore
the structure is called Crossfire in the following. Both pieces are stamped and have a
thickness of 1.5mm while the overall width is about 1042mm. They dispose of 31 spot welds
situated at the flanges. Seven of these spot welds are located in the middle part in a row that
is perpendicular to the main flange contact.

In production, the spot welds have a diameter of 5mm, however only 6mm spot welds can be
welded in the work shop at Volvo 3P. Therefore, all spot welds considered in this study are
6mm spot welds. The influence of spot weld diameter is discussed in Chapter 6 of this thesis.
The actual metal connection between the parts was measured using paper stripes fitting in
the gap between the metal plates. The measurement showed that the diameter of the actual
connection is around 8.5mm. It is assumed that this diameter is dependent on the settings of
the welding tool.

4.4 FEM model
The models are built and analyzed using the common softwares Ansa for meshing, MSC
Nastran for performing the calculations and µEta for post processing. In addition, the student
edition of Patran/Nastran is employed for analyses.

4.4.1 FEM representation
In NVH analysis, coarse meshes are commonly used. At Volvo, the target element length of
shell meshes is 10mm and large parts of the mesh can be generated automatically using triand quadrangular elements. For the analysis the simple linear CTRIAR and CQUADR triand quadrangular elements available in the Nastran library are employed. The number of
shell elements in the model is shown in Table 4-1. This low number of elements makes it
possible to calculate all frequencies and mode shapes of the test pieces up to 800Hz in
around 5 seconds on a usual personal computer.

4.4.2 Influence of sheet thinning
The result of earlier projects suggested including sheet thinning in future analyses. This has
been realized in the models for this study. As presented in Figure 16, the thickness is
especially influenced locally in the vicinity of bending radii and corners where the thickness is
reduced up to approx. 20%. The influence of this thickness variation is shown in Figure 17
where the error that is introduced without taking sheet thinning into account is displayed. It
can be seen that the error in frequency is varying between different modes and amounts to
approximately 1% in average. Further, models that include sheet thinning result generally in
lower frequencies for the two test structures and the error seems to increase with frequency.

4.4.3 Weight comparison
In order to estimate the error that stems from thickness variation of the plates and other
geometrical errors, the weights of the FE model and the real structures are compared. The
difference between the FE model and the measured weight is listed in Table 4-2. The value
of the FE model of the Topbeam is highly precise which indicates that the geometry is cut at
the right positions and that the thickness of the sheets is modeled correctly.
However, for the Crossfire test piece, the difference is 65g which indicates an error in
geometry or sheet thickness. A possible explanation is that the thickness of the steel coils
can vary up to +/- 0.1mm from production. Considering a sheet thickness of 1.5mm, the
effect can cause a variation in weight of up to approx. 230g for the Crossfire part or, in other
words, the steel thickness of the whole part is on average 0.028mm too thin in comparison to
the real structure. As will be shown later, the model for the Crossfire part is still very good.

4.4.4 Convergence
Besides sheet thickness, the question arises how large the differences between the relatively
coarse mesh of 10mm element length and a converged mesh are and how good the quality
of the FEM representation is. Therefore, a convergence study is carried out on one of the
metal panels, the Roof Member part, considering element lengths of 10, 7, 3 and 1mm.
The finding of this study is shown in Figure 18 where the results of the 1mm mesh are taken
as reference and the differences to the other meshes are plotted. The frequency difference
amounts up to around 2.5% considering the third mode of this structure. The other modes
show less difference, however. Further, the slope of all curves decreases and thus a
convergence for small element sizes can be assumed.

The result of this study is that the error introduced using a coarse 10mm mesh can be
considerable and even be more important than sheet thinning. Comparing computation time,
the CPU time to solve the 10mm coarse mesh amounted to 2.4s whereas the time to solve
the 1mm mesh was 337.8s. Therefore, such fine meshes cannot be used on whole BIW
structures but the coarse mesh has to be used.

4.5 Updating material data
Material data is associated with uncertainty especially after plastic deformation of sheet
metal. Experimental studies show that deformed sheet metals can have a decreased
Young’s modulus of significantly more than 10GPa reducing the Young’s modulus from the
initial material of approximately 214GPa to around 198GPa after applying a strain of
approximately 0.2 [22]. This influence changes for different metal alloys and steel grades and
the resulting material characteristics can be anisotropic.
As stamped sheet metal structures are employed in this thesis, a significant uncertainty in
the FEM model is implied, although the initial material properties are known exactly.
Therefore, the material properties of the single parts are updated using the optimization
algorithm that is presented above. In order to update the single parts, their modal behavior
was measured before welding. The result of the updating procedure is presented in Chapter
6.

This section describes briefly the measurement setup and the measurement results of both
single and welded parts. In the first part, the measurement setup including boundary
conditions, the excitation as well as signal processing is summarized. In the second part, the
results are presented and discussed. The creation of correct FE models is considered of high
importance in order to isolate the error caused by the spot welds thoroughly, which allows for
the assessment of different models. Since the models should be assessed using
experimental data, it is equally important that the measurement errors are minor. Thus, the
main focus is to minimize the error from all different kinds of sources.

5.1 Measurement setup
In addition to the description of the measurement setup, a list of the used measuring
equipment is attached in Appendix B.

5.1.1 Boundary conditions
A free-free setup was used. Different ways
of realizing these conditions were
considered and the final choice was the
suspension with two soft rubber bands
using holes in the structure in combination
with nylon strings. The nylon strings were
attached directly to the part with the idea
that nylon contributes less to the damping
than rubber. The realization of this setup is
shown in Figure 19 with white nylon strings
and brown rubber bands.
Figure 19

5.1.2 Response measurement

Boundary conditions for the Roof Panel
part.

Considering that the structures are relatively lightweight with thicknesses of 1.2 to 1.5 mm, a
laser is employed in order to measure the response. This has the advantage that no
additional mass is put on the structure as for measurements using an accelerometer. As a
result, especially the response frequencies are very precise. The level of noise can yet be
higher when a laser scanner is applied, especially if the laser signal is low in certain points.
The signal becomes low mainly when the laser beam and the structure are not perpendicular
in all points, for example when spherical geometries are measured. In this case, the structure

5 Measurements

31

can be set up perpendicular to the laser beam in most of the measurement points and thus
the signal is sufficient at all positions.

5.1.3 Excitation
Considering laser scanning for response
measurement, it was initially intended to
employ a shaker for excitation. It turned
out however, that the natural frequencies
could not be measured correctly using a
shaker. A result of preliminary testing was,
for example, that the first natural frequency
of the Roof Panel was measured as
18.8Hz which is differing significantly from
the correct value of 27.5Hz. It is supposed
that the dynamics of the shaker influence
the overall structural behavior resulting in Figure 20 Excitation hammer.
this large difference. An argument for this
explanation is that the tested shaker is rather large and heavy. Thus, a heavy shaker cannot
be used for such lightweight structures.
Hammer excitation is used instead. This has the advantage that no external mass is attached
to the structure ensuring that the frequencies are measured correctly. The hammer with a
soft rubber tip is shown in Figure 20.

5.1.4 Finding optimum measurement points using preliminary
calculations
The applied laser scanner has the possibility of defining a grid of measurement points
changing measuring position automatically. The scanning position is changing while the
position of excitation is the same for all points. This raises the question which excitation point
is most suitable in order to excite all modes in the range of interest. These points are points
with large displacement for all mode shapes, i.e. modes with small displacement at the
excitation point has to be avoided.
This question can be answered using preliminary calculations and the following concept.
With the goal of measuring the first 10 modes, a function can be defined that takes the
minimum value of the first ten mode shapes of preliminary FEM calculations for each grid
point separately:

In order to measure the first 10 frequencies, the frequency bandwidth was selected from 0800Hz. As the structures are lowly damped, the sample time was increased to its maximum
value of 8s considering the frequency bandwidth and limitations given by the software.
Furthermore, an exponential window is used for the velocity signal to reduce leakage and a
rectangle force window to reduce noise in the force signal. The number of averages is set to
10 but the software increases this number automatically for points with low laser signal to up
to 40. A significant improvement for noise reduction from the laser is a tracking filter that can
be imagined as a fly wheel in the velocity signal suppressing unphysical high acceleration
values.

5.1.6 Compensating damping from the exponential window
Through the use of an exponential window, the damping resulting from the measurement
data is too high, i.e. an exponential window increases damping artificially. This effect can be
compensated for with the following equation [23]:

Figure 22.

5.2 Measurement results
For the welded parts, mode shapes of measurements and calculations are compared to
determine which measured frequency has to be correlated with which of the FEM
calculations. The modes of structures with low modal density can often be correlated directly
only applying frequency data. In contrast, for structures with high modal density, modes of
measurements and calculations might be in different order.
With that consideration, experimental modal analysis is performed for the welded structures
and the single parts Roof Panel and Roof Member while only frequencies were measured for
the Cross Member and Firewall.
The modal analysis is carried out with the software vibratools and an additional code for the
calculation of MAC values developed for this thesis.

5.2.1 Frequencies
The natural frequencies obtained from the measurements are listed in Table 5-3. The
measurements were correlated with FEM data from preliminary calculations using MAC plots
that allow correlating the modes. These MAC plots are included in section 5.2.3 and allow
the conclusion that all frequencies were measured except for one frequency for the crossfire
structure. Here it is assumed that the mode was not excited.

5.2.2 Damping
The damping is estimated using the vibratools software. The results including the exponential
window compensation are shown in Figure 23. The values are in general quite low and range
from about 0.02 to 0.4% with an average of 0.061% for the single parts and 0.12% for the
welded parts.
The plots show further that the spot weld connection seems to have a major influence on the
modes 1 to 3 for the Topbeam and 6 to 8 for the Crossfire geometry. Especially mode 3 of
the Topbeam is very interesting as the structure is excited and measured on the Roof Panel
side of the part but the mode affects almost exclusively the Roof Member side with high
displacements. This seems to result in very high values for damping. Even the FRFs show a
highly damped mode.

Therefore, the conclusion is drawn that the spot welds can have significant influence on the
damping but this can depend highly on the mode. On average, the damping is twice as high
for the welded parts as for the single parts.

5.2.3 MAC comparison and mode correlation
In comparisons of measurements and calculations, the right frequencies need to be
correlated. This can either be achieved if the structures have a low modal density, i.e. the
frequencies are well separated, or by calculating MAC values. This is done for the two single
parts Roof Panel and Roof Member (Figure 24) and for both welded parts together (Figure
25). The node points of the measurement mesh are correlated with the calculations using the
closest finite element node. The respective mesh points are found using a half-automated

5 Measurements

function in Patran and the experimental mode shapes are determined with a curve fitting
method available in vibratools.
For the Roof Panel part, the modes can be correlated but it is observed that the modes 6 and
7 cannot be separated in a good way during the modal analysis. This is due to the fact that
the modes are close with a difference of only 6Hz. Therefore, the first 7 modes are used in
the objective function for optimization as indicated with the shaded cells in Table 5-3.

For the Roof Member part, the modes can be identified clearly but the sequence of the
modes is not identical between measurements and calculations. The figure shows that
modes are swapped in three cases. This complicates the definition of suitable modes for
model correlation. As a consequence, only the modes 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 were used for the
evaluation of the model.

MAC plot for the Topbeam (left) and the Crossfire part (right). Both are depicting the first
10 modes. In the Crossfire structure, the 6th mode is missing, probably due to a lacking
excitation.

For the Topbeam geometry, modal analysis is difficult for the first two modes which are quite
close and feature high values of damping. Hence, the modes cannot be separated well
during modal analysis but the result allows the assumption that the modes are in the same

sequence. In addition, these modes are verified by comparing the deformation in the
acquisition system with the measurements. The first ten frequencies are used in the objective
function.
Finally, the plot for the Crossfire structure shows that the modes could be identified clearly
but that one mode is missing in the measurement. This might be explained by a lacking
excitation. This mode does only affect a small part of the structure and it is very similar to the
neighboring mode 5 (see 0). Especially for the Crossfire geometry, the modes can be
correlated significantly better using the new spot weld model that is described in the sections
below than with the initial model. Thus, only the first four frequencies were used for
correlation as it was difficult to find matching modes before a good spot weld model was
available.
As will be shown later, the frequencies for the Cross Member and Firewall are separated
very well and can be correlated reliably without calculating MAC values.

5.3 Discussion and sources of error
All necessary frequencies and mode shapes were measured, except for one frequency of the
Crossfire part. The reason might be that the structure was cut differently than intended. Thus,
the method for identifying possible excitation points proved to be practical.
The accuracy of the measured frequencies is considered high as potential influences are
minimized. It was found that a shaker cannot be employed for such a structure and that a
hammer can be used for excitation in combination with laser response scanning instead.
Employing a hammer, it is necessary to consider that the structure moves as a consequence
of excitation and thus the measurement point changes slightly. It is assumed that the laser
moves up to 1cm in radius around the measurement position. This does not affect the
measurement results with respect to natural frequencies – which is most important for this
thesis – but the mode shapes are influenced slightly. As the wave length of the structures is
significantly larger than 1cm, the error can be seen as relatively small.
Another practical drawback of using a laser is that only one side of the welded structures can
be measured in one measurement session. Yet, this is sufficient to determine the correlation
to the calculations.
The boundary conditions are considered suitable for this kind of structures.
Finally, it is found that contact non-linearity can be of importance if the structures are excited
with a strong impact. Noise indicating contact on the surfaces between the welded parts is
observed.

This chapter represents the main part of this thesis since all of the above chapters come
together and form the results. The first results concern updating of the single parts with
respect to material data. In the subsequent step, different spot weld models are discussed
separately and optimum parameters are found. These models are compared and the best
model is identified.

6.1 Material data updating
The material data is updated using the Nastran algorithm and the analytical equations and
differences are discussed. The experimental frequencies that are used for updating the
models are listed in Table 5-3.

6.1.1 Nastran material updating
The results of the Nastran optimization SOL200 are displayed in Table 6-1. The largest
variation from the initial Young’s modulus of 210GPa amounts to 5GPa for the Firewall cutout. This implies that all values are physically reasonable, being located within the
boundaries of variations due to manufacturing.
The Poisson’s ratio, however, does not appear to be very sensitive during updating. On the
one hand, this resulted in large variations which were not physically reasonable. In general,
large variations occur if a parameter is not sensitive while the characteristics of the model,
such as frequencies, are hardly changed. Therefore, small errors in the models result in
large, unphysical variations in the parameters. The Poisson’s ratio is consequently
constrained for three structures close to the initial value of 0.3. For the Cross Member, the
result for the Poisson’s ratio is reasonable which is due to the good quality of the FE model.

6.1.2 Analytical material updating
The analytical solution that is presented in Chapter 3.4 gives similar results for the Young’s
modulus. Here, the structures are updated in a simple excel sheet instead of running the
Nastran optimization. Table 6-2 demonstrates that the results are almost identical with the
results obtained for the Nastran routine. However, this method does not take into account
variations of the Poisson’s ratio and the initial value for the density of 7.85
which explains differences to the above results.

are compared to the updated frequencies. The results are

shown in Figure 26. Calculations and measurements agree well, especially regarding the
Cross Member. By updating the material, all models are improved; significant errors of more
than 10% are only identified for the Roof Member.
One possibility to explain these differences is a local deformation in the middle of the panel
that results in geometrical deviation from the FE model.
Evaluating the two geometries Topbeam and Crossfire, there are errors in both models,
however, the Crossfire structure seems more reliable.

6.2 Optimizing the spot weld models
In the first step, the optimum parameters are determined for each model separately. In the
subsequent section, the models are compared and evaluated against each other.

6.2.1 About parameter sensitivities and the stiffness of spot welds
This first part is intended to describe sensitivity parameters qualitatively and how the stiffness
of spot welds can be understood in general.
In Figure 27, the change of the first frequency with respect to a varying nugget Young’s
modulus of the ACM 2 model is shown. The frequency changes very quickly as long as the
Young’s modulus is small and the area scale factor is low, while it changes less the stiffer the
spot weld nugget gets. Thus, it is concluded that the frequency converges to a boundary
value or, in other words, that the sensitivity of the Young’s modulus as a parameter
converges to zero.
Similarly, in Figure 28 the change of one frequency with the area scale factor is shown. For
this parameter, sensitivity does not converge to zero but it becomes very small for large
nugget sizes.

Change of one frequency with the area scale factor.

Therefore, the general rule can be formulated that the sensitivity of spot weld parameters is
very high as long as the spot weld connection is soft. For increased nugget stiffness, the
sensitivity decreases and finally converges to zero. It is assumed that this is due to the
considerably softer surrounding of the spot weld in comparison to the nugget itself and that
deformation takes place in these softer regions instead of the rigid core. The results of the
optimizations are, that the stiffness of the nugget is located close to the boundary of getting
rigid, i.e. the spot welds are very stiff and almost rigid. This leads to parameters high up in
scale and the sensitivities are close to zero.
This is also supported by the physical effect that the frequencies of a structure hardly change
while the physical diameter of a weld spot is increased. Palmonella [2] welded parts with
diameters of 5, 6 and 7mm and has found that a change in diameter hardly influences the
frequencies. This can be explained by the concept that the nugget is almost rigid and that the
surrounding of the spot weld is softer and important for the flexibility.

Further, as general guideline,

of the brick nodes is connected with the sheet

following, only parameters are considered that

elements.

These parameters consist of two different categories, 3 material properties and two shape
parameters. The material parameters are solid Young’s
Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio a
as
s well as
the solid density. The shape parameters are the area scale factor that scales the area of the
solid in relation to the real spot weld area and the RBE3 diameter. The latter is the diameter
under which all mesh nodes in the surrounding of the solid node are included in the
connection.

6.2.2.2 Towards optimum parameters and parameter sensitivities
In the following, the searching for optimum parameters for this model is described. Before the
optimization, it is discussed which of
of the parameters are sensitive and which parameters
need to be included in the optimization.

44

6 Results

To start with, the density of the solid is set to a value close to zero for all calculations. During
welding of spot welds no weight is added to the structure and the sheet metal elements
already contain all the physical mass. Thus, it is not reasonable to add an extra mass with a
solid. Depending on the size of the spot weld and the sheet thickness, this makes a
difference of several kilos for a whole body-in-white. The difference is not considered very
large but the mass distribution becomes physically correct.
The second parameter that is discussed here is the Poisson’s ratio. It was found that this
parameter could not be updated reasonably using the optimization as the models resulted in
completely different values for preliminary calculations. This indicates that the parameter is
not very sensitive and thus uncertainties in the model cause a large variation of the
parameter. Therefore, it was set to the default value of 0.3 and not included in the
optimization.
This leaves three parameters that are optimized in the following – area scale factor, patch
diameter and Young’s modulus.

6.2.2.3 Optimizing parameters
From these parameters, two are shape parameters and one is a material property. The
shape parameters have to be changed manually while the optimum value for the Young’s
modulus is found using the result from the Nastran calculation.

Optimization settings.

In Table 6-3 settings for the optimization are listed. The area scale factor was changed
manually in steps of 0.1 from 0.1 to 4 and three different patch diameters were used. These
diameters are 16mm, 10mm and the smallest one connecting the solid only to the closest
nodes. The patch diameter of the resulting FE model cannot be changed arbitrarily because
of the shell mesh size of 10mm. Therefore, the actual patch size is dependent on the location
of the mesh nodes in relation to the corner nodes of the solid.
The results are presented for both structures in five graphs, Figure 30 to Figure 34. Figure
30, Figure 31 and Figure 32 present the results for the Young’s modulus for different patch
sizes and with respect to the area scale factor. At first, the Young’s modulus is constrained
with the upper value of 900GPa and decreases for large area scale factors from this value.
The area scale factor at the beginning of the decrease changes from 0.8 to 3 for different
patch sizes and shows a similar trend for both structures, especially for the 10mm patch.

The optimization is constrained by the upper limit of

However, this value lies in the region of the upper constraint indicating that an even higher
Young’s modulus would be the optimum. Therefore, this upper constraint will be set to a
higher value later.
In the next step, the values for the objective functions are discussed and evaluated in order
to assess which of the above sets of parameters gives the lowest value. Figure 33 and
Figure 34 display the objective functions for the Topbeam and Crossfire, respectively. In
general, the objective function diverges for very small values, reaches a minimum (which is
the optimum value) and finally it increases slightly. In order to find the best model, only the
lowest values of all three curves need be compared. Here, the model with a 16mm patch
gives the highest and worst result for both structures while the model with the patch using
only the closest node gives the best results. These parameters are an area scale factor of
2.8 for the Topbeam and 2.2 for the Crossfire.
However, as discussed above, the Young’s modulus is constrained for these curves with a
value of 900GPa. Knowing that the closest node patch gives the best results, this curve was
calculated again using an upper constraint of 10000GPa instead, which is approx. 10 times
higher. With that new upper constraint, the optima are significantly lower and located at
smaller area scale factors.

values for the Young’s modulus are shown above in separate graphs. The lowest curve

49

6 Results

The optimum is reached for both curves again at the maximum value for the Young’s
modulus at the new constraint of 10000GPa but further improvement is not expected for
larger values. The solid is rigid in a physical sense and changing this value would not result
in a significant change of the model characteristics.
The final results of the overall optima are listed in Table 6-4. The results are similar but there
are differences for the area scale factor. This can be explained by the concept given in
Chapter 6.2.1. When spot welds are close to rigid, the sensitivity converges to zero. This
indicates that small differences result in large parameter variations. The objective function
curves are so flat that it almost does not matter which set of parameters employed for the
model.

It should be noted that the area scale factor of 2 is equal to a spot

weld diameter of 8.5mm. In Chapter 4 it is described that the actual metal connection
between the spot welds is 8.5mm although the spot weld diameter is 6mm on the surface.

6.2.2.4 Results evaluation
This section aims at evaluating the above model using the new parameters in comparison to
the original model at Volvo 3P and with the parameters used at Volvo Cars.
The first 10 frequencies of the Topbeam test piece are compared in Figure 35 and for the
Crossfire in Figure 36. The original model is significantly too soft and the new model
represents the stiffness of the spot weld more accurate. Especially the results for the
Crossfire are very good with exception of one mode that has a local mode shape (see
Appendix C) where a small geometry error of the model causes the difference.
It is assumed that the differences in the Topbeam test piece arise especially from the Roof
Member cut-out. This part showed errors for the single part comparison already.
The model using the parameters from Volvo Cars features an area scale factor of 3, closest
node patch and steel material properties [24]. For these calculations, the density was set to

models are exactly equal for the Topbeam as the Volvo Cars model is worse for five
frequencies and better for five frequencies. Yet, the new model performs better for the
Crossfire for which five frequencies are closer to the measurement and the Volvo Cars model
gives better results for four frequencies.

possibilities of changing the shape of the model such as mesh and core elements. Different

Furthermore, the mesh around the spot weld can feature none, one or two circles of mesh
elements and even the material properties can be changed for these elements separately.
Besides the options for different nugget elements, the parameters are thus the diameter of
the spot weld, the material properties
properties of the core and the material properties of the
circumferential zones.

results as usual, however, the frequencies and mode shapes are wrong. It is assumed that
the error either stems from a numerical error or a software implementation error in Ansa or
Nastran. This error was not observed for other core types and occurred especially for
Crossfire calculations.

Figure 39

Instability of the RBE2-bar-RBE2 nugget. The bar has a light blue color
and should connect the parts without leaving a gap. Here the instability
causes a strain of the bar that should not be possible if the element is
implemented correctly.

6.2.3.3 Parameter sensitivities
Because of the instability of the RBE2-bar-RBE2 core, a pure RBE2 nugget was
implemented that is stiff and does not allow any deformation. Figure 40 shows that the
differences between these nugget types are very small. It is concluded that the center bar of
the RBE2-bar-RBE2 approach is stiff and does not allow significant deformation with a bar
Young’s modulus of 210GPa. As a consequence, the RBE2-bar-RBE2 model can be
replaced by the rigid RBE2 element to study its behavior without significant error but avoiding
the instability.

One of the main goals of using the Spider
model is to achieve mesh independence.
Therefore, it is not considered reasonable to

circumferential zones since this would make

shear modulus is almost not sensitive
and the Young’s modulus shows a
small sensitivity.

The density of the elements in the spot weld
zone is changed with the aim of not adding any extra weight for all spot weld models. With
the results for the ACM 2 model in mind, the Poisson’s ratio was not considered either as it is
not sensitive for the spot weld nugget and cannot be updated reasonably. This is due to the
low sensitivity that is compared to the sensitivity of the Young’s modulus in Figure 41.
The only parameters being suitable for updating are the diameter of the nugget and the
Young’s modulus of the solid core. These are optimized in the next section.

6.2.3.4 Optimizing parameters
As for the ACM 2 model, the spot weld diameter is a shape parameter and has to be
changed manually whereas the Young’s modulus can be optimized using the Nastran code.
In Figure 42, the objective functions for both test pieces are plotted with respect to the
diameter of the spot weld for different core types. Running the Young’s modulus optimization
for the Topbeam resulted for all diameters up to 12mm in an optimum Young’s modulus
reaching the upper constraint of 10000GPa. This indicates that the solid core is too soft and
that a rigid connection might be favorable. Indeed, the rigid RBE2 core results in the lowest
curve for the Topbeam. One reason for the soft behavior of the solid brick core might be the
connection between the solid and shell elements. Shell elements feature rotational degrees
of freedom at the edges while the solid does only have translational degrees of freedom. This
causes a soft spot weld core especially when the spot weld hole is not filled. Because of the
same reason, all holes are filled with the intention of increasing the stiffness and thus smaller
diameters are necessary for the optimum stiffness.
The objective function of the Crossfire reaches its minimum for 11mm with a rigid core while
the values are larger for the Topbeam, here values of 12 or even 13mm might result in a
minimum.

54

6 Results

Larger diameters than 12mm are difficult to implement as the size of the spot weld becomes
very large and the edges of the flanges do not allow these values for the diameter. This
causes problems especially for the Crossfire, which is the reason why only a rigid core was
tested. Here, the mesh has to be transformed locally to create space for the spot weld.
Therefore, it is not practical to look for better models with larger diameters than 12mm and
the optimum Spider 2 model is thus a rigid nugget with a diameter of around 11mm for the
Crossfire part and 12mm for the Topbeam.
Similarly as Figure 33 and Figure 34 for the ACM 2 model, the curves have a small slope
near the optimum. It has to be considered that the area scale factor is proportional to the
square root of the diameter. This indicates that the x-axis has to be stretched in Figure 42
when the graphs are compared directly. Both diameters are used in the final evaluation part
and compared to the initial model.

6.2.3.5 Results evaluation
Finally, the results of the models with a diameter of 11 and 12mm are shown in Figure 44
and Figure 43 and compared to the initial ACM 2 model at Volvo 3P. Both models show a
significant improvement to the original ACM 2 model although the new models differ from
each other as well. For the Spider model, it seems as if the model is more sensitive to
changes in diameter than the ACM 2 model and thus its correct value is more important.
It is recommended to use the 11mm model as it is easier to implement due to its smaller
diameter. In addition, in the previous chapter where the single parts were evaluated, it turned

55

out that there are significant model errors in the Roof Member cut-out, thus the result from
the Crossfire test piece is more reliable as both parts showed only small errors.

Therefore, the final result is an 11mm Spider model using a rigid core. As discussed above,
the model that is currently available in Ansa is prone to instabilities and is therefore only
recommended with great caution and the solid nugget is too soft to be used in practice with
reasonable diameters. Thus, this model is only interesting if a rigid nugget modeled for
example with an RBE2 element can be implemented with low effort in future softwares.

6.3 Comparison
Finally, the two new models are compared with respect to their performance. The
comparison aims at a decision which model should be used in future modeling. The
frequency error is displayed in Figure 45 and Figure 46. Both models show a significantly
improved performance compared to the original model. Yet, the ACM 2 model performs
slightly better. Moreover, the ACM 2 model is more robust and does not suffer from bad
quality mesh stemming from re-meshing during implementation like the Spider 2 model.

The principal idea of the Spider 2 model is considered promising as it is an efficient way of
gaining mesh independence. If the mesh size is changed for the ACM 2 models, it might be
that another set of parameters gives optimum results. However, the currently available
Spider 2 model seems to be not fully developed and suffers from basic implementation errors
and problems with connectivities between different element types. Therefore it is
recommended to develop the Spider model further with regard to these defects.

6.4 Employing the ACM 2 model with a different diameter
In the course of this thesis, spot welds of 6mm diameter were studied while 5mm spot welds
are applied on the FH cabin. This raises the question which parameters should be employed
on the cabin model.
Palmonella found, that different spot weld sizes hardly changed the physical characteristics
of his test pieces [2]. Therefore, he recommended to model all spot weld sizes with the same
set of parameters. Further, the ACM 2 model showed low sensitivity for the area scale factor
that is equal to changing the diameter. As both the physical size of the spot weld is not
sensitive and the sensitivity of the spot weld parameter is low, it is recommended to use the
same sets of parameters for other spot weld sizes.

6.5 Comparison with literature
Palmonella et al. [2, 6 and 7] formulate modeling guidelines for the ACM 2 model and Schatz
and Eppler [24] describe the model in use at Volvo Cars.
Palmonella updated the ACM 2 using the patch size and patch Young’s modulus as main
parameters while the area scale factor and solid Young’s modulus remained unchanged.
Therefore, a direct comparison of results is not possible. Yet, one of his recommendations is
that thick plates require a softer Young’s modulus resulting in a softer connection while thin
plates require a stiffer spot weld model. The latter can also be observed for the structure in
this study. The Topbeam consists of parts with thicknesses of 1.2 and 1.5mm while the
Crossfire consists of two plates with a thickness of 1.5mm. Further, optimization in this study
resulted in parameters that are stiffer for the Topbeam than for the Crossfire. The results of
this study are thus in line with the trend reported by Palmonella.
The study by Schatz and Eppler found a good performance for the ACM 2 model with an
area scale factor of 3, closest node patch and steel material properties [24]. This model is
employed as comparison in Chapter 6.2.2.4 and referred to as Volvo Cars model. Its
characteristics are similar to the one proposed in the present study and the larger area scale
factor is compensated by a softer Young’s modulus of the solid.

6.6 Physical discussion

It can be observed that the stiffness of real
spot welds is significantly higher than
expected, especially with respect to the
diameter of the Spider nugget of 11mm

of 6mm.

diameter of 6mm. This explains the high
stiffness of the spot weld nugget partly but it is assumed that another physical effect
contributes to the high stiffness, as well.

Since analyses in structural dynamics are commonly linear, non-linear contacts are not
included. Therefore, different parts of the model can overlap. This is shown in Figure 47
where the flanges of the Topbeam cross for the first mode. In reality, this is not possible but
the flanges would support each other and thus the stiffness is higher than the model
proposes due to contact of the surfaces.

7.1 Findings
7.1.1 Achievements
In this thesis the ACM 2 and Spider 2 models have been analyzed and compared. The ACM
2 model is the most widely used model in industry and the Spider 2 is a new model with
promising characteristics. The latter is an approach to overcome mesh dependence.
These models were compared and evaluated against measurements using two cut-out parts
of an FH Volvo truck cabin. Importance was given to isolating the error that is introduced by
the spot weld models in the assembled parts as good as possible.
A step in assuring good model quality was updating the material data of the single parts. This
was done using frequencies from measurements and applying a Nastran optimization
algorithm.
The spot weld models were optimized with respect to several parameters for both structures
and the optimum spot weld model was identified. In the optimization procedure, the Young’s
modulus of the spot weld nugget was optimized using the numerical algorithm.
Three major findings could be derived from the study:
First, the ACM 2 model provided better results than the Spider 2 models. This model is
recommended for future structural dynamics analysis.
Second, this study found that the diameter of the spot weld using the Spider 2 model with a
rigid core has to be approximately 11mm for best results. The solid nugget is too soft to
model the spot weld with reasonable spot weld diameters. However, the model suffers from
instability for some of the implementation options.
Finally, a new approach of updating isotropic plates analytically has been derived and
verified on the models. This approach uses an initial FE calculation and utilizes basic
physical characteristics of isotropic FE shell structures. It is considered very powerful as it is
exact and yet large structures with millions of elements can be updated using a pocket
calculator. Therefore, the method helps saving time and effort. In addition, it was derived
analytically that updating the Young’s modulus and density of an isotropic shell structure
simultaneously does not lead to one unique solution but many equal combinations are
possible.

7 Modeling guidelines, recommendations and outlook

7.1.2 Modeling guidelines
In this study, the ACM 2 model showed the best performance. It is thus recommended for
modeling spot welds in structural dynamics. Optimum parameters were found as an area
scale factor of 2, a patch diameter using the closest shell mesh nodes, a Young’s modulus of

such that no extra mass is

These recommendations are valid for a shell mesh size of 10mm. For refined meshes, it is
recommended to set the RBE3 diameter to approx. 5mm as this is the average diameter for
a closest node patch. Otherwise the model is at risk of becoming too soft. (see [24])

7.2 Discussion and recommendations
7.2.1 Methodological recommendations for future analysis
A result of this study is that it is very valuable to use an optimization in order to improve
models, especially for updating material properties. For the ACM 2 model, several hundred
calculations were conducted with varying shape parameters for which the optimum Young’s
modulus was found automatically. If the optimum Young’s modulus had to be found by
changing the value manually it is estimated that the number of calculations would have been
ten times higher. Thus this approach is reducing time and effort significantly.
Further, for single parts with an isotropic Young’s modulus, analytical equations can be
applied that are exact and contribute to reducing effort and time. In order to update FE
models analytically, one FE calculation is necessary and the equations find the optimum
values using experimental frequencies and the ones from the reference FE calculation. From
analytical derivations, conclusions can be drawn that it is not possible to update the Young’s
modulus and density of a structure simultaneously as they influence the characteristics of the
FE model in the same way. This results in an infinite number of optima of the objective
function which implies that an infinite number of combinations of Young’s modulus and
density result in the same optimum model characteristics.
The comparison method of defining an objective function comparing the first frequencies
proved to give good results. In addition, it is necessary to assure correct mode correlation of
experimental and calculated modes applying the modal assurance criterion. The advantage
of this method is that modes can be correlated if their does not align between experiments
and calculations. If FRF functions are compared directly, it is not possible to correlate modes
correctly if their order does not match. Therefore, it is recommended to compare frequencies
if experimental modal analysis is possible.
Considering the measurement setup, the combination of laser scanning and impulse hammer
excitation gives optimum results considering frequencies. Higher levels of noise are accepted
that stem from the laser vibrometer and are due to low signal quality in some points. It was

7 Modeling guidelines, recommendations and outlook

concluded that a shaker cannot be used for such lightweight structures as influence on the
structures’ dynamics is significant.

7.2.2 Discussing influences of modeling errors
Noticeable errors for some of the models raise questions about sources of errors. Six main
sources of differences between calculations and measurements can be found for the studies
conducted in this thesis:
•

Differences between CAD geometry and physical geometry

•

Mesh convergence

•

Material data uncertainty

•

Sheet thickness including sheet thinning and thickness of steel coils

•

Measurement errors

•

Connector (spot weld model)

Out of these types of errors, five are related to the computer model and one is related to the
measurements.
The errors resulting from measurements are considered minor as the geometries were
suspended freely vibrating without significant influence of other structures and the
frequencies of this structure could be identified clearly.
Further, the material data was updated reducing the level of uncertainty. Remaining
questions concern possible anisotropy of the steel material.
The sheet thickness was included in the models and, in addition, it was shown that its
influence amounts only to approx. 1% of the frequencies.
These considerations leave three major sources of uncertainty.
The Roof Member part showed noticeable differences between measurements and
calculations. For this part even the connector uncertainty can be excluded as it is a single
panel. A convergence study was carried out for this part resulting in differences of maximum
3%. Hence, the small errors in geometry have to be the reason for these errors.
This allows drawing the conclusion that the geometrical complexity of the employed test
pieces is assumed to be a major source of error in the present study. The size of the parts
and number of spot welds are considered adequate but the complex three dimensional
shape of the parts causes difficulties. A possible improvement for future studies could be
using geometries where the shape is controlled more easily such as profiles with straight
edges.

7.2.3 Suggestions for further studies
During the course of this study, new questions emerged concerning spot weld models. A first
question addresses the Spider 2 model and possibilities of improving it. The characteristics

62

7 Modeling guidelines, recommendations and outlook

of the ACM 2 model are influenced by the mesh size and shape of the patch [6], therefore
the Spider model represents a promising approach to overcome this problem. The thesis
found that the current implementation suffers from errors and that there is a potential of
improving the model by implementing other types of core elements such as a pure RBE2
nugget. Therefore it is suggested to develop this idea further in a similar project.
Another question concerns the influence of different sheet metal thicknesses on the spot
weld models. Palmonella [6] recommends to model the spot weld connecting thin plates
stiffer than thicker plates. Today, all connections of parts with different sheet thicknesses are
however modeled using the same model for all thicknesses. In addition, in practice sheets
with different thicknesses are welded together. Table 7-1 shows the number of spot welds
with respect to different sheet metal thickness combinations in one spot weld in an FH cabin.
The most common spot weld in this cabin is, according to the table, a spot weld connecting a
0.8 and 1.2mm thick metal sheet. Thus, the influence of different sheet metal thicknesses on
the stiffness of spot welds is another possible topic for future studies.

Appendix A Nastran source code

In Nastran, two different source codes were used, SOL103 that calculates frequencies and
mode shapes and SOL200 that was used to perform the optimization. As the first code was
developed at Volvo, it is not printed here; the second code is an important part of this thesis
and is therefore shown below.
The following code allows material data to be optimized such that eigenfrequencies fit
experimental value as close as possible. The material data is given as Young’s modulus,
Poisson’s ratio and density and their nominal value has to be set to the same value as in the
.bdf file. These values are marked in green. Moreover, the material value has to be adjusted
to the value of the material definition in the .bdf file; these values are marked in red. The first
three (or even more) experimental frequencies should also be included at the blue positions.
Finally, the file containing the model data is included at the position that is marked in yellow.
