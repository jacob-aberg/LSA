Abstract
Some of the most significant comfort disturbances in heavy vehicles can often be related to
the wheels. In those cases, the vibration of the vehicle is excited by for example force
variations within the tire, ovality of the tire or imbalance in the wheel. The disturbances are
dependent on vehicle speed and are often perceived as most unpleasant at cruising speed on a
motorway, at around 90 km/h.
Truck manufacturers want to increase the robustness against this type of disturbance, since
this results in an improved operator comfort. But it also makes it possible to lower the
requirements on the suppliers of tires and rims, and thereby there is a financial gain for both
customer and manufacturer.
The aim with this project is to increase the understanding of wheel induced vibrations. In
order to achieve this a literature survey has been performed on the subject. Furthermore, the
phenomenon has been studied analytically by using a quarter car model which includes a
brush tire model. The model is scripted in MATLAB.
Simulations have been performed to analyse the effect on the chassis when forces excited by
mass imbalance and radial run out are introduced.
When looking at the second harmonic radial run out imperfection the unsprung mass, i.e the
wheel, starts to bounce during the settling time.
Also when comparing two different weights of a mass imbalance the power increase of the
vibration in the sprung mass is much larger than the power increase of the unsprung mass at
the specific frequency. This implies that the excitation frequency, the wheel rotation
frequency in this case, is a harmonic repetition of the sprung mass undamped natural
frequency.
To avoid this phenomenon the undamped natural frequency of the sprung mass must change
either by adding a damper or by changing the weight or the spring stiffness. The simulation is
run with a damper although without it the power increase would be much larger.

Introduction

The most significant discomfort felt by truck drivers is connected to vibrations caused by
wheel and tire imperfections. Examples of these kind of imperfections are wheel imbalance,
force variations and ovality of the tire. Since manufactures spend a lot of money on
perfecting their vehicles for maximal comfort, finding better solutions for vibration isolation
is essential. Solutions that are less complicated and time consuming will cheapen the process,
improve comfort and lessen demands on suppliers.
The aim of this report is to analyse and understand the emergence of vibrations induced by
wheels and tires on trucks. In order to do this, a literature survey has been performed on the
subject. To understand the phenomenon further, an analysis has been made of a truck model.
The model consists of a quarter car model combined with a physical tire model, together
representing the front axle dynamics of a truck. Figure 1 shows the front axle of a truck of the
same dimensions as the one used in the model. Frequency and power spectral analysis are
used to investigate the models behaviour during different load cases, connected to wheel/tire
non-uniformities.
When it comes to the model, a few assumptions and simplifications have been made. The
road surface is assumed to be smooth, since the wheel forces caused by non-uniformities are
usually only significant for relatively smooth roads, where they can be of the same magnitude
as the forces generated by road excitation [1]. In the tire model, the amount of tread slices
(the bristles of rubber on the tire surface) are kept constant. The tire model can interpret
vibrations and force variations in all directions, but the study has been limited to simulations
in the vertical direction. This tire damping is assumed to be zero.
Our supervisor is Assistant Professor Jenny Jerrelind, and she has guided us through-out the
whole process. The model was supplied and written by PhD-student Johannes Edrén, who has
helped us with some add-ons and an explanatory introduction to the model itself.
The outline of the report is as follows. Chapter 2 introduces tire and wheel imperfections,
what causes them and the effects of their presence. Thereafter, in Chapter 3, the model and
method are described. In Chapter 4, the results are presented and discussed. Thereafter
Chapter 5 features a reflection and an analysis of the results. These chapters are followed by
references, and appendixes including the MATLAB-script of the model and all load cases.

Tire/Wheel non-uniformities

There are three directions of forces that are of interest when analysing tire vibrations. Lateral,
tractive and radial forces. Lateral forces are perpendicular to the direction of motion and
cause wobble, tractive forces are forces in the direction of travel, and radial forces are forces
out from the centre of the wheel, i.e. centrifugal forces. The causes of the variation of these
forces are divided into three groups; mass imbalance, geometry variations and stiffness.
2.1 Mass Imbalance
An unbalanced system is an asymmetric system, and an asymmetric system is a system which
isn’t optimally behaved. There are two different kinds of mass imbalance in the front wheeltire-assembly, dynamic and static imbalance.
A non-uniform and asymmetric mass along the axis of rotation is the cause of dynamic
imbalance. This imperfection results in torque variations perpendicular to the rotational axis.
Static imbalance is when there is asymmetry of mass along or about the axis of rotation. This
kind of imbalance causes deviations of radial (centrifugal) and tangential forces.
Both dynamic and static imbalance are functions of speed, and therefore higher speeds cause
more vibrations. These two types of imperfections can exist together, but one can also exist
while the other one doesn’t [2-3]. See Figure 2 for a closer understanding of forces acting
during imbalance.

Figure 2 – Mass imbalance on wheels in rotation [8].

2.2 Geometry variations
Variations in the geometry of a tire, usually due to manufacturing errors, have disruptive
effects on the ride of a vehicle. Some of the effects are listed below;
o

Radial run-out affects the roundness of the wheel. Radial irregularity causes the
tire to adopt an asymmetric shape; eccentric, oval, triangular or square, and
therefore the wheel rolls irregularly [2]. Figure 3 shows the first four harmonics of
radial run-out.

2

Figure 3 – Radial run-out, first four harmonics [8].

o

Lateral run-out is the deviation of the sidewalls, of the tire, from a perfect plane.
This causes vibrations, like all other imperfections, but the contribution towards
the overall ride is very small compared to radial run-out [3].

o

Belt run-out is when the belt ring is off centre from the centre of rotation. This
kind of run-out is included in mass imbalance as well, seeing as the belt’s mass
isn’t centred. The effect of belt run-out is the variation of tractive forces, causing a
radius
deviation
of
the
wheel
assembly
[4].

o

Tread gauge variation indicates a difference in the thickness and/or length of the
tires tread slices [4].

2.3 Tire Stiffness
The elasticity of a tire can be compared to that of springs, all pointing out from the centre of
the wheel. The variation in stiffness of the elastic parts of the tire can be described with the
theory of springs – the springs can have different lengths in their compressed state, which
causes inconsistent stiffness. This analogy gives quite a good idea of how stiffness can be
interpreted when discussing tires.
Tires have a body of rubberised fabric underneath the tread for stability. The difference
between bias tires and radial tires is the direction of the chords in the fore mentioned fabric
body. Bias tires have two or more plies with cords in a 35 to 40 degrees angle to the
circumference ([6], p. 69). Radial tires have parallel plies that are places in a 90 degree angle
to the circumference. They also have a belt between the body and the tread, made up of fabric
or steel wire, whose cords are roughly in a 20 degree angle to the tread. This belt helps
keeping the tread flat on the road during cornering.
Nowadays, as is the case for most vehicles, trucks have radial tires as steer tires. Variations of
stiffness in radial tires are due to manufacturing errors, and since these are most certainly
uncommon, only one tire will be affected. And even if two tires are affected, they will most
certainly be a phase shift between the tires, and so the ride will be uneven – causing
vibrations [2]. Figure 4 shows how the wheel rolls unevenly due to stiffness variation.

Figure 4 – Uneven roll due to stiffness variations [8].

Model, Method and Parameters

This chapter introduces the MATLAB-model, how it has been used and what parameters the
simulations are based on.
3.1 Quarter car model
The tire non-uniformities excite movement in the truck through the spring and shock
absorber. To simulate this, a quarter car model has been used together with a physical tire
model. The quarter car model consists of two masses, two springs and two dampers, as seen
in Figure 5. In this model, the tire’s spring and damper are embedded in the physical tire
model. The index ´s´ being for sprung mass, ´u´ for un-sprung mass, and ´t´ for tire.

Figure 5 – Quarter car model’s basic set-up.

This two DOF system has two equations of motion;
𝑚𝑠 𝑥̈ 𝑠 + 𝑏𝑠 (𝑥̇ 𝑠 − 𝑥̇ 𝑢 ) + 𝑘𝑠 (𝑥𝑠 − 𝑥𝑢 ) = −𝑚𝑠 g

(1)

̇ 𝑢𝑔
𝑚𝑢 𝑥̈ 𝑢 − 𝑏𝑠 (𝑥̇ 𝑠 − 𝑥̇ 𝑢 ) − 𝑘𝑠 (𝑥𝑠 − 𝑥𝑢 ) + 𝑏𝑡 𝑥̇ 𝑢 + 𝑘𝑡 𝑥𝑢 = 𝑘𝑡 ℎ + 𝑏𝑡 ℎ − 𝑚

(2)

Dividing both equations with the corresponding masses, the acceleration of each body can be
calculated,
which
can
be
derived
from
Newton’s
second
law;
𝑏𝑠 (𝑥̇ 𝑢 − 𝑥̇ 𝑠 ) + 𝑘𝑠 (𝑥𝑢 − 𝑥𝑠 )

−𝑔
𝑚𝑢

(4)

𝑥̈ 𝑠 =

𝑥̈ 𝑢 =

These accelerations are then transferred from time domain to frequency domain using Fourier
transform. This makes it possible to produce a graph showing at which frequencies the
vibrations cause the greatest accelerations within the different components.
To simulate the mass imbalance in the tire and rim, a centrifugal force is added to the wheel
centre. This force can then be phase shifted to move it around the circumference of the tire in
the starting position. The phase shift is only varied when several non-uniformities are
combined in one simulation so that the faults don’t end up at the same place in the wheel. The
equation used to implement mass imbalance in the model is as follows;
𝐹𝑖𝑚𝑏 = 𝑚𝑖𝑚𝑏 ∙ 𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑏 ∙ 𝜔2 ∙ sin⁡(𝜃 + 𝜑)

(5)

𝑚𝑖𝑚𝑏 is the mass of the imbalance, 𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑏 is the radius on which the mass is positioned, 𝜔 is
the angular speed of the wheel, 𝜃 is the position of the mass, and 𝜑 is the phase shift. This
force
is
then
added
to
Equation
(4)
as
follows;

𝑥̈ 𝑢 =

𝑘𝑡 ℎ + 𝑏𝑡 ℎ̇ + 𝑏𝑠 (𝑥̇ 𝑠 − 𝑥̇ 𝑢 ) + 𝑘𝑠 (𝑥𝑠 − 𝑥𝑢 ) − 𝑏𝑡 𝑥̇ 𝑢 − 𝑘𝑡 𝑥𝑢 + 𝐹𝑖𝑚𝑏

For this specific problem, the undamped natural frequencies are of interest to visualise
approximately where in the frequency spectrum resonance will occur. To calculate these
frequencies

3.2 Physical tire model
To simulate the tire physically, this part of the model is constructed using the idea of a brush
with a user specified amount of bristles. The model is based on the brush tire model presented
in Hans Pacejka’s book ´Tire and Vehicle Dynamics` [7]. The brush is spread around a part
of the circumference of the tire. As the tire rotates the brush moves along the circumference 5

this is to save computer power and to shorten the time it takes to complete the simulation,
since the amount of bristles can be kept down without affecting the resolution of the results.
The bristles are the only things that comes in contact with the road, hence the bristle data
decides the deformation of the tire. To get good results from the tire model, the bristles are
adjustable in both damping and spring stiffness in all directions. In this study however, the
vertical direction is the only direction evaluated.
To simulate radial run-out, the circumference of the tire is varied by adding a sinus curve,
which in turn can be adjusted to obtain different harmonic repetitions of the run-out.
The road surface is also adjustable to simulate road roughness, although for this project the
road surface is set as perfectly smooth. This is to keep focus on the tire imperfections, and not
confuse them with other discrepancies.

3.3 Flow chart of the MATLAB-model
The MATLAB-program consists of the tire model and a quarter car model. A flow chart has
been made to illustrate the process of the simulation, see Figure 6. For a complete study of
the MATLAB-program see Appendix B, together with all the function files.

3.4 Method
To make an accurate evaluation of how the imperfections affect the chassis, the MATLABmodel is simulated for different load cases. These load case have been chosen in order to
represent the disturbances caused by mass imbalance and radial run-out.
The first kind of tire imperfection alternated in the model is mass imbalance. Load case 2, 7
and 8 are affected by this. In load case 2, the wheel is affected only by mass imbalance,
whereas in load case 7 the mass imbalance is combined with a 90 degree phase shift and a
radial run-out of the first harmonic. In load cases 3 through 6 the wheel is subjected to radial
run-out of the first four harmonics. Load case 8 is a combination of two cases, each with a
different mass imbalance, 0.5 kg and 8 kg. Table 1 has all the information about the load
cases. The radius 0.5 m used in the load cases with mass imbalance is the radius of the wheel,
and so the mass imbalance is situated on the circumference.

Stiffness is not varied in any of the load cases. This is because stiffness variations only affect
the results homogenously and the difference, if noticeable, will only be in amplitude of the
force or power peaks.
According to Thomas D. Gillespie [2], higher order harmonics of radial run-out are
unnecessary to include in a survey about ride perception, as they show similar information
only in smaller magnitude at higher frequencies. Also, the magnitude of radial force
variations is relatively independent of speed, only the frequency is changed. It is therefore
sufficient to investigate the first four harmonics of radial run-out.
In Deodhar, Rakheja and Bhat’s report about vibration and tire force transmissibility, it is
mentioned that radial run-out is a much larger cause of vibrations than tangential and lateral
geometry variations [5].
Both reports state that radial run-out is an important, if not vital, part of vibration analysis.
This has been taken into consideration when the load cases were chosen, hence the large
percentage of load cases where radial run-out is included.

7

Furthermore, in Deodhar, Rakheja and Bhat’s report [5], a half car model is used to simulate
load cases similar to the ones in this report. Their range of imbalance mass, for the front tirewheel assembly, is set to 0.5 kg – 2 kg. For all load cases in this report incorporating mass
imbalance, except load case 8, a mass of 2 kg has been chosen. The reason for choosing the
top end of the range given by Deodhar et al. is the conviction that a larger weight will cause
larger fluctuations in vibration amplitudes. The conviction is also that this will produce
graphs with clearer peaks and dips.
In load case 8, the two masses have been chosen to 0.5 kg and 8 kg. This is because 0.5 kg
seemed to be the lowest value still causing noticeable vibrations, and 8 kg was chosen to be
unreasonably high, so as to see a striking difference in the results.

3.5 Parameters
In Table 2 the parameters for the model are specified. The vehicle model represents the front
axle dynamics of a truck. The speed of the truck has been chosen to 89 km/h which is the
average cruising speed of a Swedish motorway.

Results and Conclusions

This chapter discusses and evaluates the results of the tests simulated with the model. Due to
limitations in report length, some load cases’ graphs are exclusively situated in Appendix A.
Load case 1, 2, 4 and 8 show the most distinct results, and are therefore discussed more
closely.

4.1 Load case 1
This load case reveals what forces and vibrations would be on a tire without any exterior
forces or geometry variations. The tire is perfectly round and symmetrical, and the centre of
the wheel is concentric with the axis of rotation. This load case is meant as a reference case to
compare the other load cases to.
In Figure 7, the settling forces that occur when the system is released from the starting
position are visualised by fluctuations at low frequencies. These fluctuations will be present
in all following graphs, in somewhat different shapes and forms.
Since the tire and road are without imperfections, the forces of the sprung mass (chassis) and
unsprung mass (tire) will be similar to each other. The amplitudes, shown by the green and
blue lines, will therefore be co-linear.

Figure 7 – Vertical force amplitude as a function of frequency.

The power spectral density graph below, Figure 8, shows where in the frequency spectra the
vibrations have the largest energy per second. This does not mean that the vibration
amplitudes have to be very big, just that the transmitted effect is large and more difficult to
cancel out.

9

Figure 8 – Power spectral density graph.

4.2 Load case 2
In this load case, the tire is laden with a mass imbalance of 2 kg, situated on the
circumference.
As expected, Figure 9 shows a peak in the force of both the sprung and unsprung masses at
the wheel rotation frequency. This is due to having a single mass imbalance adding a
centrifugal force to the wheel centre, and since the mass imbalance rotates at the same
velocity as the wheel, their frequencies will coincide.
The force amplitude is almost ten times higher for the unsprung mass than for the sprung
mass. This is because the spring and damper in the strut absorb a lot of the forces caused by
the mass imbalance in the tire.

10

Figure 9 – Vertical force amplitude as a function of frequency.

Figure 10 shows that the relationship between tire and chassis is reversed when comparing
power instead of force, at the wheel rotation frequency. The increase of power in the sprung
mass is much greater, which implies that the wheel rotation frequency must coincide with a
resonance frequency.

Figure 10 – Power spectral density graph.

11

4.3 Load case 4
Load case 4 presents a tire with a radial run-out of the 2nd harmonic. The difference in radius
is 5 mm in two places opposite to each other, making the tire oval.
Figure 11 shows that the first force amplitude peak occurs at around 14-15 Hz, which is very
close to the second harmonic of the wheel rotation frequency. This was expected due to the
fact that there are two “bumps” on opposite sides of the circumference. Compared to load
case 2, there are now two excitation forces per revolution, thus the doubled frequency.
The following peaks are the harmonic repetitions of the excited vibration. After these clear
peaks, the simulation result seems to have a lot of noise, although this is not the case. It only
appears so due to the logarithmic scale.

Figure 11 – Vertical force amplitude as a function of frequency.

The power spectral density of load case 4, visualised in figure 12, shows how a large power
increase in the higher frequency spectra. The wheel, during this simulation, leaves the ground
when bouncing immediately after being let go from the starting position. Therefore it is
possible to see a large dip in the force-frequency graph, Figure 11, and a smaller first peak in
Figure 12. The force at this point will decrease immensely in size, and the largest peak in the
power spectral density graph will therefore come after this point, when the wheel regains
contact with the road. The highest peak in Figure 12 is at a frequency of 30 Hz, and is the
second harmonic of the vibration frequency. In Figure 12 we can also see that the power
affecting the sprung mass grows larger than the power affecting the unsprung mass, which
indicates that a radial run-out of the 2nd harmonic excites vibrations with a lot of power to the
sprung mass, i.e. the chassis.
12

Figure 12 – Power spectral density graph.

4.4 Load case 8
This load case is made up of two different load cases, compared in the same graphs. They
both consist of a tire with a mass imbalance; one of 8 kg and the other of 0.5 kg, both on the
circumference.
Figure 13 shows the amplitude spectrum of the forces affecting the chassis through the strut.
The lower frequencies forces come from the settling of the truck after releasing it from the
starting position. These forces will not be considered in the analysis. The peak close to the
wheel rotational frequency is the force that repeatedly excites the chassis, causing vibration to
the driver. The weight increase of the mass imbalance in the tire assembly does not affect
where in the frequency spectra the forces act, although it does change the amount of force
acting on the strut.

13

Figure 13 – Force amplitude over frequency spectra.

By drastically changing the weight of the mass imbalance it is possible to visualize how the
variation of mass of the imballance affect the chassis and the tire. Studying the the purple line
in Figure 14, which represents the wheel rotational frequency of the tire which is 7.54 Hz at
the rolling speed of 89 km/h, it is clear that there is a power increase for both the tire and
chassis. Also visible in the figure are the undamped natural frequencies these were added for
comparison with the power peaks.

14

Figure 14 – Power spectral density graph.

5.

Reflection, Discussion and Analysis

When looking at the PSD graphs, comparing the undamped natural frequencies of the chassis
to the wheel rotation frequency of the tire, it becomes clear that the power peaks coincide
with these frequencies. It can also be seen that the power increase of the chassis’ vibrations is
larger than the power increase of the tire’s vibrations. This suggests that a harmonic
repetition of the natural frequency of the chassis is very close to the rolling frequency. When
dividing the rolling frequency with the undamped natural frequency of the chassis, results
show that the rolling frequency is almost equal to the 5th harmonic repetition of the chassis
natural frequency.
These results imply that vibrations excited to the chassis (from the wheels, through the strut)
will multiply in amplitude due to the fact that the natural frequency coincides with a
harmonic of the rolling frequency. The consequences are unnecessarily large vibrations, and
there are ways to solve this. To overcome this problem the natural frequency of the chassis
must be changed, either by changing the weight of the vehicle or the spring stiffness.
Load case four should be a subject for future analysis since it is the load case which transfer
most power to the sprung mass over a wide frequency spectrum.
For further analysis of the model it should be expanded with to a half car model together with
the cab and driver seat. This would show what type of imperfection will have the most effect
on the driver.

7.6 Load case 6
Load case 6 presents a tire with a radial run-out of the 4th harmonic. The difference in radius
is 5 mm in four places evenly spaced along the circumference, making the tire seem square.
For results, see Figures 35-38.

7.7 Load case 7
The tire in this load case is affected by a mass imbalance of 2 kg on circumference, a 90
degrees phase shift, and a 1st harmonic radial run-out. Results are shown in Figures 39-42.

7.8 Load case 8
This load case is made up of two different load cases, both affected by a mass imbalance; one
of 8 kg and the other of 0.5 kg, both on the circumference. Results are shown in Figures 4345.
