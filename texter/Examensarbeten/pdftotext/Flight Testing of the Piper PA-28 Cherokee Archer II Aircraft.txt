Abstract
It is sometimes easily assumed that an experimental measurement
will closely mimic the results from an associated theoretical model.
The purpose of this project is to determine how close to a theoretical
model —involving the component buildup method and the quadratic
drag polar assumption— a Piper Archer II will perform in an actual
test flight.
During the test flight, the Archer II showed a similar correlation
between airspeed and performance as the model. The actual performance numbers were however consistently lower than their theoretical
counterpart.

Introduction
The primary question this report seeks to answer is if an experimental
measurement of an aircraft’s performance in the form of a test flight
closely resembles the performance determined from a model consisting
of a component buildup method and a quadratic drag polar assumption.
The aircraft that we will be examining and test flying —the PA28-181— is a variant of the Piper PA-28 more commonly known as
the Piper Cherokee Archer II. The Piper PA-28-181 will henceforth
be referenced to as the Archer II.
The Piper PA-28 aircraft has since its introduction in 1960, by the
Piper Aircraft manufacturer, been one of the most iconic and widely
used general aviation aircraft. There is still to this day variants of the
PA-28 in production and the total number of aircraft that has been
built is greater than 32,000.
The Archer II variant is like the original PA-28 design a single
engined, piston powered, low-wing aircraft with a conventional tricycle
landing gear. The variant was certified in 1975 and is powered by a
Lycoming O-360-A4A four-cylinder engine rated at 180 horsepower at
2700 rpm and features a laminar airfoil semi-tapered wing.
The performance of the Piper PA-28-181 aircraft will be experimentally analysed in terms of maximum climb rate, glide ratio and
stall speed through a testflight in the Archer II conducted by ourselves. The result will be compared both to a theoretical model and
the corresponding performance numbers given in the aircraft’s Pilot
Operating Handbook.

Performance Analysis

The first step when determining the performance of an aircraft is to
calculate the drag coefficient as it is the base for all subsequent equations. The drag coefficient is based on the geometry of the aircraft,
e.g. wing-areas and component lengths.

1.1

Estimate Drag coefficient

The drag coefficient, CD , can be calculated with the use of the zero-lift
drag coefficient, the drag-due-to-lift factor and the lift coefficient as
follows.
CD = CD0 + KCL2

(1)

The zero-lift drag coefficient is calculated based on the geometry
of the aircraft, the drag-due-to-lift coefficient and the lift coefficient is
given from the geometry of the wing.

2

1.1.1

Zero-lift drag coefficient

There are two different methods to estimate the zero-lift drag coefficient, CD0 . The most simple method is the equivalent skin-friction
method which is based on the total wetted area and a skin-friction
coefficient for different aircraft classes. The other method is the component buildup method which is a little more detailed as it is based on
parameters that is calculated for the specific aircraft. In this project
the component buildup method have been chosen due to the fact that
the geometry of the aircraft is known [5].
CD0 =

1X
[CF,c Fc Qc Swet,c ] + ∆CD,misc + ∆CD,L&P
S c

(2)

The parameters CF,c , Fc , Qc and Swet,c is calculated according
to given formulas [1] where the geometry of the aircraft is taken into
consideration. ∆CD,misc is taken from a table of known features of the
Archer II [4][p. 179].

1.1.2

The component flat-plate skin friction coefficient

The flat-plate skin friction coefficient, CF,c , is based on the stream
wise length of the component being studied and can be calculated
according to equation (3).

1.1.4

Wetted area

The wetted area, Swet,c , is the area which is in contact with the external airflow. This area is calculated differently for different components.
Wings are calculated according to equation (10) and the fuselage is
calculated according to equation (9).

where ρ can be determined from the current altitude and temperature,
V is the current speed and S is the area of the wing.

1.2

Glide ratio

The glide ratio can be determined from the relation between the lift
coefficient and the drag coefficient.
glide ratio =

(15)

With this relation where the lift coefficient is a changing parameter dependent on speed and altitude the glide performance can be
determined for all possible scenarios.

1.3

Climb performance

Climb performance is about more than just the maximum rate of
climb, the climb angle also needs to be taken into consideration as
they give different results. The speed for best climb angle does not
have to be the speed for best for rate of climb1 .

1.3.1

Rate of climb

The rate of climb parameter, R/C, is a parameter that depends on the
current conditions. It is dependent on the current speed, air density
and weight of the aircraft. It can be calculated according to [2] as

The relation between the propeller efficiency and advance ratio for
the Archer II can be found in a table [4] where the propeller efficiency
can be determined from a corresponding advance ratio. When assigning a rotational speed of 2400 rpm, the airspeed becomes the only
unknown parameter. As the airspeed is the only unknown parameter
the propeller efficiency can be plotted as a function of the airspeed as
seen in figure 2.

Flight test

In addition to the theoretical analysis of the performance of the Archer
II, a test flight has been performed. The purpose of the test flight was
to examine and compare the data from the flight with the corresponding analytically calculated data.
The test flight included four elements; a maximum climb test, a
glide test and a stall speed test.

2.1

The Atmosphere

Our planets atmosphere is varying in terms of air density at different
locations, altitudes and at different times. An aircraft’s performance
is also affected by the air density in which it moves. In order to standardize and benchmark an aircraft’s performance, the International
Standard Atmosphere –henceforth referenced to as the ISA– is therefore commonly used. The aircraft’s performance is generally presented
as the performance it would have in this standard atmosphere.
Ideally, the aircraft’s performance would be determined by test
flying it in the ISA. The ISA is however a desk construction and it
rarely –if ever– appears in the real world. Because of this, the aircraft’s
performance needs to be converted to the corresponding values in the
ISA from the values gathered in the actual atmosphere at the time of
the test flight.
The ISA specifies the standard pressure and temperature in the
atmosphere. The altimeter inside the aircraft measures the static
pressure on the outside and is calibrated in accordance with how the
pressure varies with altitude in the ISA2 . In usual cases, the altimeter
setting is set to the actual pressure at sea level but for our test flight it
is set to the standard setting if 1013 hPa (or 29.92 inHg). This means
that the altimeter will show the pressure altitude, which is the altitude
in which the ISA altitude has the same pressure as exists outside of
the aircraft. Note that this is not the actual altitude of the aircraft,
except if it flies in an atmosphere with identical pressure variation as
the ISA.
Knowing the pressure altitude does not however mean that the
density of the air is known because the density of the air does also
depend on the temperature 3 . The compensate for any temperature
deviations from the ISA and calculate the density altitude John T.
2

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altimeter#Use_in_aircraft
The density of the air does in fact also depend on humidity. The more moist the air
is, the less dense it is since the molecular weight of water is lighter than that of air. This
effect is however negliable in our climate.

Lowry suggests the following method, called the inchworm method [3].
To derive the method one starts with the atmospheric hydrostatic
differential equation
dp = −ρgdh
(22)
combined with the ideal gas law,
p = RgρT

(23)

α —the temperature lapse rate— , p0 —the pressure at sea level—
and T0 —the temperature at sea level— are all defined parameters in
the ISA (α = 0.00650 C/m, p0 = 1013.25 hPa and T0 = 15 ◦ C).
Differentiating (25) gives

With (31) it is possible to calculate the height difference in the
standard atmosphere, ∆h, given the temperature at the various pressure altittudes, T (p) and the corresponding temperatures in ISA,
T (hp ). It is however considerably easier and more practical to evaluate the integral in (31) by using the mean values at the ends of the
interval:

(32) is a good approximation since the temperature generally varies
slowly and steadily at the pressure altitude ranges we will be concerned
with.
In practice, this means that only the temperature at the beginning
of the pressure altitude range, T (hp1 ), and at the end of the range,
T (hp2 ), would have to be recorded during the test flight, together with
the pressure altitudes themselves.

2.2

Testing Procedure

At the day and time of the test flight, ground temperature and gross
weight of the airplane were noted and the altimeter was set to 1013 hPa
as to read pressure altitude directly. Once the pre-flight checks and
procedures were completed and the aircraft was airborne the testing
could begin.
The maximum climb test was conducted as follows; the aircraft’s
throttle was kept fully open and the aircraft’s indicated airspeed was
kept constant during the steady vertical climb. The time to climb
between two altitudes and the temperature at those altitudes were
noted as well as the propellers rpm. The glide test was conducted in
a similar manner to the maximum climb test with the exception that
the throttle was kept closed while the aircraft descended at idle power
through the two altitudes.
The maximum climb and glide procedures were repeated several
times at various airspeeds, increasing with 10 kt increments.
The stall speed was noted in a idle power, level stall.

10

The flight instruments , such as the speed-indicator and altimeter,
were recorded with a video camera during the entire flight for further
analysis of the data on the ground.

2.3

Flight Data Analysis

Once on the ground again, the flight data were analysed. ∆h was
calculated in accordance with (32) and divided with the recorded climb
time to obtain the equivalen rate of climb in the standard atmosphere

Using these values into equation (2) results in the final sum for

From the theoretical analysis of the aircraft’s performance the following data were computed: The glide ratio as a function of the aircraft’s indicated airspeed is shown in figure 3. The maximum climb
rate at various airspeeds is represented in figure 4 and figure 5 shows
how the climb angle is varying with airspeed. The airspeed for best
rate of climb, Vy , was calculated as 78.6 knots. The Pilot Operating Handbook does under the same conditions present a value of 76
knots [6]. The Archer II will, according to the POH, climb at a maximum rate of 735 feet/min at sea level and maximum gross weight.
The comparable value from the theoretical performance model is 1040
feet/min.
Vx , the airspeed for best climb angle is lower, 64 knots according
to the POH and 55 knots according to our theoretical model.
The best glide ratio for the Archer II is, with the theoretical model
used 12.6, higher than the value provided by the POH, which is 10.1.
The stall speed of the Archer II is 53 knots at a flaps-up configuration at sea level and MTOW according to the POH. Our calculations
give a stall speed at the same circumstances of 59 knots.

Test flight performance

The maximum climb and glide ratio tests during our test flight were
all conducted between the pressure altitudes of 3000 and 4000 feet.
The climb rates and glide ratios are therefore compared to the theoretical values with the average air density between those altitudes
(corresponding to a density altitude of 3565 feet in this case). The
actual weight of the aircraft at the time of the test flight was determined to be 924 kg so the theoretical values in the comparisons were
calculated using that weight as well. The comparisons are presented
in figure 6 for glide ratios, in figure 7 for climb rates and in figure 8
for climb angles.
The Archer II has a relatively unpronounced making it somewhat
difficult to determine the exact stall speed during the test but the
aircraft stalled at around 50 kts.

Discussion

The first test flight that was conducted took place in an erratic and
turbulent atmosphere which resultet in unconsistent and unreliable
data. It was therefore decided that another test flight should be performed. The second test flight occured under much more favorable
conditions with more consistent measurements as a result. The measurements from the second flight are the only ones that are included
in this report.
The distribution of the value from the glide ratio tests does resemble the theoretically calculated curve under the same conditions. The
actual glide ratios are however all lower than their theoretical counterparts as seen in figure (6). The same tendency can be seen for the
climb angles in figure 8 as well. The distribution is similar but the
test flight performance numbers are lower.
The systematic tendency of the practical values to be lower could
be explained with factors making the aircraft perform worse such as a
dirty fuselage, less than ideal maneuvering from the pilot and in the
case of the climb test; an aged and underperforming engine and/or
propeller.
Other factors might include uncalibrated altimeter, thermometer,

16

stop watch and/or airspeed indicator as well as erratic pressure and
temperature in our altitude range. These factor might as well though
induce errors with the opposite tendency.
The comparable values from the theoretical model at MTOW and
the POH suggests that the theoretical model used gives an overestimation of the Archer II’s performance. That would imply a smaller
difference between the aircraft’s optimal performance and the measured performance from our test flight than is shown in figure (6)-(8).
There is however, one scenario where the measured data does not
match the pattern from the theoretical model; the maximum rate of
climb scenario. The measured data implies a relationship were the
rate of climb increases with decreased airspeed unlike the theoretical
curve which has a conversely quadratic shape. This might be due
to the effect the propeller slipstream has on the other parts of the
aircraft.
When the propeller is turning at a high rate, a considerably air flow
will be prodiced which blows past the inner section of the main wing.
This effectively lowers the angle of attack of the inner part of the wing.
This effect might give the impression of the aircraft performing better
at lower airspeeds than expected, because the propeller slip stream in
fact adds air flow over a big section of the wing making it perform as
if the actual airspeed was higher. That would also explain why the
aircraft seems to perform best at a higher airspeed during the glide
test, in which the propeller slip stream effect is much smaller.

Conclusions
• The component buildup method gives an overestimation of the
Archer II’s performance compared to the Pilot’s Operating Handbook
• The data measured from the test flight have a similar distribution
as the values derived from the theoretical model.
• The measured data does consistently indicate lower performance
than the theoretical model under the same circumstances
• Favourable conditions during the test flight is beneficial to the
gathered measurements.

Division of Labour
Emil has been responsible for the planning and conducting of flight
testing and the part attributed to that in the report. He has also
written the discussion and introduction parts in the report.
Fredrik has been responsible for the theoretical model and calculations and has written that part in the report as well.
With that said, most of the project has been a shared commitment
and we have helped each other on all parts of the project.
